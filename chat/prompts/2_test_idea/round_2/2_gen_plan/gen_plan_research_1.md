<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Phonological Density Does Not Predict DLM Strength
hypothesis: >-
  Languages with higher phonological density do not exhibit systematically stronger dependency distance minimization (DLM).
  Cross-linguistic tests across 55 languages from 10 families show no significant relationship between phoneme inventory size
  and mean dependency distance (Spearman r = 0.19, p = 0.17; R² = 0.05), with the weak correlation running opposite to the
  predicted direction. Phonological density and syntactic optimization appear to operate as largely independent constraints
  on linear order. Any residual phonological effect on DLM is likely mediated not by direct compression of syntactic dependencies
  but by alternative compensatory mechanisms: (1) phonological reduction of words adjacent to long-distance dependencies,
  (2) increased morphological marking to clarify grammatical roles without linear proximity, or (3) modulation at the phonological
  phrasing/prosodic interface rather than the syntactic level. The null finding itself constitutes a contribution: it establishes
  that the phonotactic constraint hypothesis — the idea that phonological crowding 'hoards' adjacency slots for syntactic
  optimization — does not hold at the cross-linguistic level. Future tests should (a) control for phylogenetic non-independence
  using mixed-effects models with language family as random intercept, (b) distinguish between phoneme-space span (phonemes
  in intervening words) and phoneme-weighted distance (distance weighted by connected word phoneme counts), and (c) test for
  modality-specific effects using spoken corpora where available.
motivation: >-
  Current dependency distance research suffers from two blindspots: (1) all work uses WORD-SPACE distance, missing phonological
  proximity constraints; (2) no one has tested whether phonological density modulates the strength of syntactic minimization.
  The findings on comparable information rates across speech and writing suggest speakers optimize around channel capacity.
  By shifting the unit of analysis from words to phonemes, this hypothesis joins the phonotactic/phonemic layer with the syntactic
  layer to reveal a cross-layer cost constraint that explains otherwise puzzling cross-linguistic patterns in DLM strength.
assumptions:
- >-
  UD treebanks are comparable across languages for extracting dependency distance patterns
- >-
  Phoneme inventory sizes and syllabification patterns are reliably available in cross-linguistic resources (e.g., Glottolog,
  Lexibank)
- >-
  The interaction between phonological density and syntactic optimization is not confounded by other typological factors (word
  order, distance-based rankings can be controlled)
- >-
  Spoken language treebanks (e.g., read speech, news corpora) sufficiently capture the phonological pressures that drive spoken
  communication efficiency
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Collect UD treebanks (commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace) and phonological density measures for 40+ languages
  (5+ from each of 8 typologically diverse families). 2. Measure dependency distance distributions (mean, variance, tail behavior)
  using the newly proposed phoneme-position adjacency metric: for each dependency hedge-d-dependent span, compute phoneme-position
  difference rather than word-position difference, weighted by constituent phoneme counts. 3. Control for word-order typology
  (OV/SVO/VSO) and overall distance-based rankings from prior work. 4. Test statistical relationship between phonological
  density metric and DLM strength using hierarchical regression: DLM as response, phonological density as primary predictor,
  language family as random effect, word-order as fixed covariate. 5. Cross-validation within language families to control
  for shared history. 6. Secondary analysis: compare how well this explains variance in DLM across modalities where possible.
success_criteria: >-
  The core hypothesis succeeds if: (1) Linguistic regression shows phonological density is a significant positive predictor
  of DLM strength (more dense = stronger minimization), above and beyond word-order typology; (2) The effect holds across
  5+ independent language families; (3) Family-level patterns emerge consistent with drift rather than sampling noise; (4)
  Sensitivity analyses (controlling for syllable count, stress patterns) confirm the phonological effect is not confounded.

inspiration: >-
  Three cross-field insights combined: (1) MODALITY INTEGRITY (Coupé et al. 2019) - Languages optimize structural properties
  around communicative constraints; (2) MULTIMODAL EFFICIENCY (Rasenberg et al. 2022) - Teams minimize joint effort across
  different behavior types; (3) CROSS-LEVEL CONSTRAINT - Phonological density in chemistry/statistics hoards local configuration
  space, limiting elsewhere. The novel mechanism is borrowing the 'constraint competition' principle from materials physics:
  when one constraint type tightly occupies physical space (phonological adjacency), other systems must adapt (syntactic proximity)
  with different strategies. The phoneme-space dependency metric makes this competition observable.
terms:
- term: Dependency distance minimization (DLM)
  definition: >-
    The tendency of syntactically related words (heads and dependents) to be linearly close to each other in a sentence, reducing
    processing cost.
- term: Mean dependency distance (MDD)
  definition: >-
    The average absolute linear distance between heads and dependents, averaged over all dependency arcs in a corpus—currently
    the dominant aggregate DLM metric.
- term: Phonological density
  definition: >-
    A cross-linguistic measure combining phoneme inventory size, phonotactic complexity (legal consonant clusters), and the
    number of distinct syllable types; higher, or is the most widely reported dependency-distance summary.
- term: Phoneme-position adjacency matrix
  definition: >-
    An extension of token-space distance metrics where dependency distances are computed not in word positions but in underlying
    phoneme character positions, weighted by each word's constituent phoneme count.
- term: Functional vs. lexical dependencies
  definition: >-
    A dichotomy from Gerdes (2026): functional dependencies (determiners, case markers, auxiliaries) are universally short
    because grammar 'hard codes' their adjacency; lexical dependencies (subjects, objects, modifiers) are longer and constrained
    by typology.
summary: >-
  A phonotope density hypothesis predicting that languages with denser phonological inventories exhibit stronger dependency
  distance minimization, tested by measuring dependency distance in phoneme-space U wrongmost from HuggingFace and correlating
  DLM strength with phonological density across 40+ languages.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Same conceptual frame refined: evidence rejects original positive prediction in favor of null hypothesis
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Reversed primary prediction: phonological density does NOT predict stronger DLM; weak positive correlation found instead
  (r=0.19, p=0.17)
- >-
  Null finding reframed as contribution: establishes phonological density and syntactic optimization as independent constraints
- >-
  Added phylogenetic control requirement: mixed-effects models with family random intercept needed to address 28/55 Indo-European
  sample skew
- >-
  Proposed alternative mechanisms: phonological reduction of adjacent words, increased morphological marking, prosodic-phrase-level
  mediation

- >-
  Added requirement to engage with Ferrer-i-Cancho & Gomez-Rodriguez (2021) who tested reverse direction (DLM -> phonological
  compression) using UD treebanks
- >-
  Narrowed scope to cross-linguistic level only; acknowledged that effects may operate at different timescales (diachronic
  phonology vs. synchronic syntax)

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.

GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

### [2] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-09-08 00:06:40 UTC

```
Direction: Computational Linguistics — Dependency Distance Minimization Across UD Treebanks. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that measures dependency-distance distributions across UD treebanks, investigates whether spoken language minimizes more than written, characterizes how typology interacts with the pattern, and identifies families that deviate. MUST use commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace.

Ambition: level 3 of 5 — phenomenological science: surface and rigorously characterize a new empirical regularity or anomaly in the data, even before a full theoretical explanation exists.

Reviewer: I am Kaja Dobrovoljc (JSI / University of Ljubljana). Calibrate from my existing papers. Cross-domain methods (information theory, mixed-effects models, sequence models) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for ACL, EMNLP, or the Computational Linguistics journal. Audience: computational linguists and quantitative typologists. Tone: empirically rigorous, careful with linguistic detail, reproducible on public UD.

# Computational linguistics — field handbook

## Overview

Scope: computational linguistics as a SCIENCE of language — what models reveal about language and
about human language processing, and how such claims are measured. NLP engineering (training,
prompting, retrieval, agents) is out of scope. The star is the SUBSTRATE below: a dated,
source-anchored map with an explicit do-not-redo list. The only IDEATION lens is open questions;
a thin execution floor follows it.

**How to use this map.** It is a STARTING POINT, not a substitute for looking. Its crowded
list is necessarily incomplete and its frontier is dated; map-silence means *not-yet-checked*,
never *open*. Before committing to any direction, run your own fresh, dated saturation search
on that specific direction and confirm it is actually unoccupied. Treat the sections below as
material to reason against — the questions especially — rather than as conclusions to accept.

## Organizing principles (how the field reasons)

- **The measurement instrument is itself under audit.** A 445-benchmark, 29-reviewer systematic review found "patterns
  related to the measured phenomena, tasks, and scoring metrics which undermine the validity of the
  resulting claims" [S2] — a capability claim is judged on its construct, not just its number.
- **Output is not competence.** "LLMs' metalinguistic judgments are inferior to quantities directly
  derived from representations" [S3]; grammaticality separates in hidden states where string
  probability does not [S12].
- **A negative result about a model is a claim about your probe:** "negative results relying on
  metalinguistic prompts cannot be taken as conclusive evidence that an LLM lacks a particular
  linguistic generalization" [S3].
- **Disagreement is data.** Human label variation "reflects the diversity of human perspectives
  rather than mere error"; collapsing it manufactures "artificial consensus" [S7].
- **Explanatory status is graded, and the grades are named.** LLMs supply "how-possibly
  explanations (HPEs)" about acquisition and competence, while "current LLMs do not yet satisfy"
  the requirements for how-actually explanations [S4].
- **Theory bounds the empirics** — expressivity results explain "why current transformer
  architectures struggle to implement exact discrete algorithms" [S24] — but they are
  assumption-relative by construction [S11].

## Frontier (recency-weighted)

**Measurement & construct validity** *(weight-capped — the loudest thread)*

- A systematic review of 445 LLM benchmarks by 29 expert reviewers found validity-undermining
  patterns across measured phenomena, tasks and scoring metrics [S2] (NeurIPS 2025).
- The JUDGe 2026 workshop frames judge validity as a systems property: "Evaluation validity is not a property of
  a judge in isolation" [S25] (2026). Peer-reviewed baseline beneath it: reliability varies by
  property, judge expertise, and whether text is human- or model-generated [S21] (ACL 2025).
- Contamination has its own position paper, which sets out to "highlight the wide prevalence of
  benchmark dataset contamination and outline the properties of contamination-resistant datasets"
  [S14] (ICML 2026 Position Track).

**What LMs represent vs what they output**

- A grammaticality probe "outperforms LM probability-based grammaticality judgments" — yet
  on semantic plausibility "the probe however performs worse than string probability" [S12] (2026-05).
- ACL 2026's Best Paper found a directional semantic failure: a "pervasive Teleological Bias" where
  models "hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events, even overriding explicit textual
  cancellation"; prompting interventions "partially reduce this bias but trigger a calibration
  crisis" [S8] (2026).

**Cognitive modelling and the scale paradox**

- Surprisal's fit to reading times peaks near two billion training tokens, after which perplexity
  gains produce "poorer fits to human reading times" [S16] (Findings of EMNLP 2023).
- Not an artifact of latency measures — the inverse relation "still obtains" on two fMRI datasets
  across 17 LMs [S17] (EACL 2026).
- The predictor is unstable: early-layer representations beat surprisal on early-pass eye movements,
  and "the best-performing predictor varies strongly depending on the language and eye-tracking
  measure" [S23] (ACL 2026).

**The resource map and language varieties**

- Catalogue counts mislead: 59% of the surveyed languages score zero catalogued-dataset density, yet literature mining shows active dataset production for many [S5] (2026-05).
- The dominant multilingual benchmark is criticized at protocol level — many translations "fall below
  the claimed 90% quality standard", and "copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU
  scores" [S13] (EMNLP 2025).

**Annotation, disagreement, pluralism**

- The perspectivist turn has its own survey, mapping "a shift from consensus learning toward
  explicitly modeling disagreement, and toward capturing structured relationships among
  annotators" [S6] (2026-01).

**Meta-science of the field**

- Submission volume outran reviewing capacity — 17,087 submissions against 1,424 area chairs,
  with the community weighing "options for limiting submissions for the first time in ACL's
  history" [S1] (2026-05) — yet measured review quality shows "no consistent decline in median
  review quality across venues and years" [S22] (2026-01). ACL 2026's special theme was model
  explainability [S10].

## Recent (~1–2 yr, compressed) · Durable core

- Durable and still load-bearing: surprisal theory as the LM-to-processing-cost bridge [S16];
  minimal-pair evaluation as the standard syntactic instrument [S12]; direct probability
  measurement as the stronger read-out of linguistic knowledge [S3]; the child-learning data
  bound — "less than 100 million words" — with curriculum learning, heavily attempted,
  "largely unsuccessful" [S18].
- The three standing stances on LLMs and linguistic theory [S4]: **insulationism** (LLMs are
  irrelevant to human language), **eliminativism** (they can replace traditional linguistic
  theories), **conciliationism** (they are useful tools for linguistic research).

## ⛔ Already crowded — go ELSEWHERE (do-not-redo)

The blank space is NOT in these lanes; each is saturated through H1-2026:

- **Creating another multilingual / low-resource benchmark.** Dense and institutionalized: the
  FLORES+ family plus its published protocol critique [S13], variety-level suites [S19], and
  and a 232-paper survey of the multilingual/edge pipeline [S20].
- **Benchmark-contamination detection.** Saturated; the prevalence of contamination and the
  properties of resistant datasets are already laid out in a peer-reviewed position paper [S14].
- **LLM-as-judge meta-evaluation and bias catalogues.** A 20-dataset / 11-model peer-reviewed study
  [S21] plus a dedicated 2026 workshop [S25] own this.
- **Minimal-pair grammaticality evaluation and its representation-level follow-up.** Models already
  "discriminate well between grammatical and ungrammatical sentences in tightly controlled minimal
  pairs", and the probe-vs-probability comparison is published [S12].
- **Human label variation / perspectivist modelling.** Mapped end-to-end by its own survey [S6] and
  already escalated into post-training [S7].
- **Computational morphology and low-resource dependency parsing.** Both have their own survey and
  a 2026 cross-architecture evaluation [S29] [S30].
- **Computational sociolinguistics / dialect NLP.** Mapped by its own survey [S27], with a
  variety-level benchmark already published [S19].
- **Sign-language processing tooling and reproducibility.** The ad-hoc-code problem and a framework
  answer to it are published [S28].
- **Language-documentation annotation tooling.** 98 tools already surveyed against documentary
  requirements [S26].
- **Coreference and discourse resolution.** A shared-task series in its fifth edition, with a 2026
  benchmark wave alongside it [S31].
- **Diachronic / lexical semantic change.** Mature enough that its canonical benchmark is itself
  under published critique, with a dedicated workshop series [S32].
- **Surprisal-vs-reading-time psychometrics.** The inverse-scaling result, its tipping point, its
  fMRI generalization, and its layerwise refinement are all published [S16] [S17] [S23].

> **Standing directive — this list is necessarily INCOMPLETE.** Map-silence means *not-yet-checked*,
> NOT *open*. Before committing to any direction this map does not explicitly flag as crowded, run a
> fresh, dated saturation search and confirm the space is actually unoccupied. (Measured in this forge's own
> A/B runs: a live-searching baseline beats a static handbook precisely on the crowded lanes a map omits.)

## Open questions the field hasn't answered

*(the whole lens — the reader answers in their own way)*

1. Prompted output underestimates linguistic knowledge [S3], and grammaticality separates in hidden
   states where string probability does not [S12]. **Is the observable this field treats as its
   measurement — model output, or string probability — even the right object for a claim about
   linguistic competence?** Instruments changed without this being settled.
2. If a review of 445 benchmarks finds validity-undermining patterns [S2] while judge validity is a
   property of a whole pipeline rather than a judge [S25], what would a capability claim here have
   to report before it should be believed?
3. LLMs supply how-possibly but not how-actually explanations of language [S4]. What evidence would
   move a computational result across that line, and does any current design even address it?
4. The best cognitive predictor is a deliberately undertrained model [S16] [S17], while the strongest
   predictor varies by layer, language, and measure [S23]. What is being modelled when psychometric
   fit and language-modelling quality pull in opposite directions?
5. Catalogue counts and literature evidence disagree about which languages are resourced [S5], and
   the dominant benchmark is protocol-flawed for exactly those languages [S13]. Is "low-resource" a
   property of languages, of documentation infrastructure, or of evaluation design?
6. Submission volume outran reviewing capacity to the point of considering caps [S1], yet measured
   review quality has not declined [S22]. If the bottleneck is not quality, what is the constraint
   actually selecting for in what gets published?

## What counts as DEEP here (taste)

## Critical rules (execution · eval · validity)

| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Test linguistic knowledge by prompting the model to judge. | Designing the probe: read probabilities directly where possible; report prompting as a second, weaker measurement — never as sole evidence for absence. | wrong-result — negative results are unsound from prompts alone | L | [S3] |
| Report benchmark accuracy as a capability claim. | Writing the claim: define the construct, say how items operationalize it, and report uncertainty. | wrong-result — the score does not measure the named phenomenon | L | [S2] |
| Use FLORES+ as ground truth for low-resource MT quality. | Choosing the eval set: check quality and domain fit for your languages and add a naturalistic set — models strong on one can look weak on the other. | wrong-result — the benchmark's own quality bound caps your conclusion | L | [S13] |
| Aggregate annotations to a majority label by default. | Handling annotation: decide explicitly whether disagreement is error or signal for THIS task; preserve the distribution when it is signal. | wrong-result — artificial consensus erases the phenomenon | L | [S7] [S6] |
| Reach for a pretrained transformer parser on a low-resource language. | Choosing the architecture: below the data crossover a Biaffine LSTM beats transformers, and morphological complexity widens that disadvantage. | wasted-cost — the bigger model is the weaker one in that regime | L | [S30] |
| Call a language low-resource from catalogue counts. | Scoping resources: check literature-level dataset circulation, not just registered catalogues, before claiming a data gap. | wrong-result — the gap may be documentation, not data | L | [S5] |
| Argue cognitive plausibility from a bigger, better LM. | Making a processing claim: treat training data and model scale as deliberate variables and report layer and measure — the best predictor changes with both. | wrong-result — the inverse relation holds on latency and fMRI alike [S17]; fit peaks near 2B training tokens [S16] | L | [S16] [S17] [S23] |

## Decision guide

- **Competence vs performance:** for "does the model know X", read probabilities or probe
  representations [S3] [S12]; for "does it use X when generating", behavioral output is right —
  do not swap them.
- **Cognitive-modelling target:** latency and fMRI now agree on inverse scaling [S16] [S17]; early-
  vs late-pass measures disagree on the best predictor [S23] — name the measure before the model.
- **Aggregating annotations:** aggregate when the task has a defensible single answer; preserve the
  distribution when variation is interpretive [S6] [S7].
- **Placing yourself in the theory debate:** the field names three positions — insulationist,
  eliminativist, conciliationist [S4]; a paper implies one whether or not it says so.

## Ground rules (known-lane — terse)

- Surprisal = negative log probability of a word in context; the standard LM-to-processing-cost link [S16].
- Minimal pairs = near-identical sentences differing in acceptability; BLiMP-style suites are the
  canonical syntactic instrument [S12].
- Human label variation (HLV) = legitimate annotator disagreement, distinct from annotation error [S7].
- Construct validity = whether a measure represents the phenomenon it names; now a routine reviewer
  question in this field [S2].

## Reference documentation

- **[volatile.md](volatile.md)** — dated frontier numbers, lane-occupancy flags, and per-source
  review status. Re-check this FIRST before any novelty verdict or write-up.

## Candidate lane  ⚠️ (expert to resolve — NOT verified)

- ⚠️ **No peer-reviewed 2026 synthesis of "what computational linguistics is now" was recoverable
  this pass.** A Philosophy Compass survey of the philosophy of language models exists but was
  paywalled; the field-identity framing rests on one preprint [S4] plus venue artifacts [S9] [S10].
  Confirm before asserting a field-wide consensus in a write-up.
- ⚠️ **The ACL 2026 award slate could not be read with committee rationale** — the page lists titles
  only, so the taste row rests on the paper's own abstract [S8] plus the journal's printed criteria
  [S9], not a meta-review. Confirm/refute: an award rationale or area-chair commentary for ACL 2026.

## Available Web Tools

Three levels of web tools:

1. **WebSearch** — broad discovery. Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Cheapest. Use first to scan the landscape.
2. **WebFetch** — read a specific page. LLM summarizes it. HTML only. May miss specific details.
3. **aii_web_tools__fetch_grep** — exact text extraction from HTML or PDF. Regex matching with context windows.
   Use for precise details, methodology, or when WebFetch missed something.
   Key params: pattern (required), max_matches (default 20), context_chars (default 200 per side).

**Workflow:** WebSearch → WebFetch for gist → aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact details or PDFs.

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
# The script and its requirements live in the aii-web-tools skill — this one ships prose only.
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Phonological Density Does Not Predict DLM Strength
hypothesis: >-
  Languages with higher phonological density do not exhibit systematically stronger dependency distance minimization (DLM).
  Cross-linguistic tests across 55 languages from 10 families show no significant relationship between phoneme inventory size
  and mean dependency distance (Spearman r = 0.19, p = 0.17; R² = 0.05), with the weak correlation running opposite to the
  predicted direction. Phonological density and syntactic optimization appear to operate as largely independent constraints
  on linear order. Any residual phonological effect on DLM is likely mediated not by direct compression of syntactic dependencies
  but by alternative compensatory mechanisms: (1) phonological reduction of words adjacent to long-distance dependencies,
  (2) increased morphological marking to clarify grammatical roles without linear proximity, or (3) modulation at the phonological
  phrasing/prosodic interface rather than the syntactic level. The null finding itself constitutes a contribution: it establishes
  that the phonotactic constraint hypothesis — the idea that phonological crowding 'hoards' adjacency slots for syntactic
  optimization — does not hold at the cross-linguistic level. Future tests should (a) control for phylogenetic non-independence
  using mixed-effects models with language family as random intercept, (b) distinguish between phoneme-space span (phonemes
  in intervening words) and phoneme-weighted distance (distance weighted by connected word phoneme counts), and (c) test for
  modality-specific effects using spoken corpora where available.
motivation: >-
  Current dependency distance research suffers from two blindspots: (1) all work uses WORD-SPACE distance, missing phonological
  proximity constraints; (2) no one has tested whether phonological density modulates the strength of syntactic minimization.
  The findings on comparable information rates across speech and writing suggest speakers optimize around channel capacity.
  By shifting the unit of analysis from words to phonemes, this hypothesis joins the phonotactic/phonemic layer with the syntactic
  layer to reveal a cross-layer cost constraint that explains otherwise puzzling cross-linguistic patterns in DLM strength.
assumptions:
- >-
  UD treebanks are comparable across languages for extracting dependency distance patterns
- >-
  Phoneme inventory sizes and syllabification patterns are reliably available in cross-linguistic resources (e.g., Glottolog,
  Lexibank)
- >-
  The interaction between phonological density and syntactic optimization is not confounded by other typological factors (word
  order, distance-based rankings can be controlled)
- >-
  Spoken language treebanks (e.g., read speech, news corpora) sufficiently capture the phonological pressures that drive spoken
  communication efficiency
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Collect UD treebanks (commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace) and phonological density measures for 40+ languages
  (5+ from each of 8 typologically diverse families). 2. Measure dependency distance distributions (mean, variance, tail behavior)
  using the newly proposed phoneme-position adjacency metric: for each dependency hedge-d-dependent span, compute phoneme-position
  difference rather than word-position difference, weighted by constituent phoneme counts. 3. Control for word-order typology
  (OV/SVO/VSO) and overall distance-based rankings from prior work. 4. Test statistical relationship between phonological
  density metric and DLM strength using hierarchical regression: DLM as response, phonological density as primary predictor,
  language family as random effect, word-order as fixed covariate. 5. Cross-validation within language families to control
  for shared history. 6. Secondary analysis: compare how well this explains variance in DLM across modalities where possible.
success_criteria: >-
  The core hypothesis succeeds if: (1) Linguistic regression shows phonological density is a significant positive predictor
  of DLM strength (more dense = stronger minimization), above and beyond word-order typology; (2) The effect holds across
  5+ independent language families; (3) Family-level patterns emerge consistent with drift rather than sampling noise; (4)
  Sensitivity analyses (controlling for syllable count, stress patterns) confirm the phonological effect is not confounded.

  Three cross-field insights combined: (1) MODALITY INTEGRITY (Coupé et al. 2019) - Languages optimize structural properties
  around communicative constraints; (2) MULTIMODAL EFFICIENCY (Rasenberg et al. 2022) - Teams minimize joint effort across
  different behavior types; (3) CROSS-LEVEL CONSTRAINT - Phonological density in chemistry/statistics hoards local configuration
  space, limiting elsewhere. The novel mechanism is borrowing the 'constraint competition' principle from materials physics:
  when one constraint type tightly occupies physical space (phonological adjacency), other systems must adapt (syntactic proximity)
  with different strategies. The phoneme-space dependency metric makes this competition observable.
terms:
- term: Dependency distance minimization (DLM)
  definition: >-
    The tendency of syntactically related words (heads and dependents) to be linearly close to each other in a sentence, reducing
    processing cost.
- term: Mean dependency distance (MDD)
  definition: >-
    The average absolute linear distance between heads and dependents, averaged over all dependency arcs in a corpus—currently
    the dominant aggregate DLM metric.
- term: Phonological density
  definition: >-
    A cross-linguistic measure combining phoneme inventory size, phonotactic complexity (legal consonant clusters), and the
    number of distinct syllable types; higher, or is the most widely reported dependency-distance summary.
- term: Phoneme-position adjacency matrix
  definition: >-
    An extension of token-space distance metrics where dependency distances are computed not in word positions but in underlying
    phoneme character positions, weighted by each word's constituent phoneme count.
- term: Functional vs. lexical dependencies
  definition: >-
    A dichotomy from Gerdes (2026): functional dependencies (determiners, case markers, auxiliaries) are universally short
    because grammar 'hard codes' their adjacency; lexical dependencies (subjects, objects, modifiers) are longer and constrained
    by typology.
summary: >-
  A phonotope density hypothesis predicting that languages with denser phonological inventories exhibit stronger dependency
  distance minimization, tested by measuring dependency distance in phoneme-space U wrongmost from HuggingFace and correlating
  DLM strength with phonological density across 40+ languages.

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Phonological Density Does Not Predict DLM Strength
hypothesis: >-
  Languages with higher phonological density do not exhibit systematically stronger dependency distance minimization (DLM).
  Cross-linguistic tests across 55 languages from 10 families show no significant relationship between phoneme inventory size
  and mean dependency distance (Spearman r = 0.19, p = 0.17; R² = 0.05), with the weak correlation running opposite to the
  predicted direction. Phonological density and syntactic optimization appear to operate as largely independent constraints
  on linear order. Any residual phonological effect on DLM is likely mediated not by direct compression of syntactic dependencies
  but by alternative compensatory mechanisms: (1) phonological reduction of words adjacent to long-distance dependencies,
  (2) increased morphological marking to clarify grammatical roles without linear proximity, or (3) modulation at the phonological
  phrasing/prosodic interface rather than the syntactic level. The null finding itself constitutes a contribution: it establishes
  that the phonotactic constraint hypothesis — the idea that phonological crowding 'hoards' adjacency slots for syntactic
  optimization — does not hold at the cross-linguistic level. Future tests should (a) control for phylogenetic non-independence
  using mixed-effects models with language family as random intercept, (b) distinguish between phoneme-space span (phonemes
  in intervening words) and phoneme-weighted distance (distance weighted by connected word phoneme counts), and (c) test for
  modality-specific effects using spoken corpora where available.
motivation: >-
  Current dependency distance research suffers from two blindspots: (1) all work uses WORD-SPACE distance, missing phonological
  proximity constraints; (2) no one has tested whether phonological density modulates the strength of syntactic minimization.
  The findings on comparable information rates across speech and writing suggest speakers optimize around channel capacity.
  By shifting the unit of analysis from words to phonemes, this hypothesis joins the phonotactic/phonemic layer with the syntactic
  layer to reveal a cross-layer cost constraint that explains otherwise puzzling cross-linguistic patterns in DLM strength.
assumptions:
- >-
  UD treebanks are comparable across languages for extracting dependency distance patterns
- >-
  Phoneme inventory sizes and syllabification patterns are reliably available in cross-linguistic resources (e.g., Glottolog,
  Lexibank)
- >-
  The interaction between phonological density and syntactic optimization is not confounded by other typological factors (word
  order, distance-based rankings can be controlled)
- >-
  Spoken language treebanks (e.g., read speech, news corpora) sufficiently capture the phonological pressures that drive spoken
  communication efficiency
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Collect UD treebanks (commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace) and phonological density measures for 40+ languages
  (5+ from each of 8 typologically diverse families). 2. Measure dependency distance distributions (mean, variance, tail behavior)
  using the newly proposed phoneme-position adjacency metric: for each dependency hedge-d-dependent span, compute phoneme-position
  difference rather than word-position difference, weighted by constituent phoneme counts. 3. Control for word-order typology
  (OV/SVO/VSO) and overall distance-based rankings from prior work. 4. Test statistical relationship between phonological
  density metric and DLM strength using hierarchical regression: DLM as response, phonological density as primary predictor,
  language family as random effect, word-order as fixed covariate. 5. Cross-validation within language families to control
  for shared history. 6. Secondary analysis: compare how well this explains variance in DLM across modalities where possible.
success_criteria: >-
  The core hypothesis succeeds if: (1) Linguistic regression shows phonological density is a significant positive predictor
  of DLM strength (more dense = stronger minimization), above and beyond word-order typology; (2) The effect holds across
  5+ independent language families; (3) Family-level patterns emerge consistent with drift rather than sampling noise; (4)
  Sensitivity analyses (controlling for syllable count, stress patterns) confirm the phonological effect is not confounded.

  Krielke (2024) - Diachronic shift toward intra-phrasal dependency relations in scientific English and German, hinting at
  phonological-density interaction
inspiration: >-
  Three cross-field insights combined: (1) MODALITY INTEGRITY (Coupé et al. 2019) - Languages optimize structural properties
  around communicative constraints; (2) MULTIMODAL EFFICIENCY (Rasenberg et al. 2022) - Teams minimize joint effort across
  different behavior types; (3) CROSS-LEVEL CONSTRAINT - Phonological density in chemistry/statistics hoards local configuration
  space, limiting elsewhere. The novel mechanism is borrowing the 'constraint competition' principle from materials physics:
  when one constraint type tightly occupies physical space (phonological adjacency), other systems must adapt (syntactic proximity)
  with different strategies. The phoneme-space dependency metric makes this competition observable.
terms:
- term: Dependency distance minimization (DLM)
  definition: >-
    The tendency of syntactically related words (heads and dependents) to be linearly close to each other in a sentence, reducing
    processing cost.
- term: Mean dependency distance (MDD)
  definition: >-
    The average absolute linear distance between heads and dependents, averaged over all dependency arcs in a corpus—currently
    the dominant aggregate DLM metric.
- term: Phonological density
  definition: >-
    A cross-linguistic measure combining phoneme inventory size, phonotactic complexity (legal consonant clusters), and the
    number of distinct syllable types; higher, or is the most widely reported dependency-distance summary.
- term: Phoneme-position adjacency matrix
  definition: >-
    An extension of token-space distance metrics where dependency distances are computed not in word positions but in underlying
    phoneme character positions, weighted by each word's constituent phoneme count.
- term: Functional vs. lexical dependencies
  definition: >-
    A dichotomy from Gerdes (2026): functional dependencies (determiners, case markers, auxiliaries) are universally short
    because grammar 'hard codes' their adjacency; lexical dependencies (subjects, objects, modifiers) are longer and constrained
    by typology.
summary: >-
  A phonotope density hypothesis predicting that languages with denser phonological inventories exhibit stronger dependency
  distance minimization, tested by measuring dependency distance in phoneme-space U wrongmost from HuggingFace and correlating
  DLM strength with phonological density across 40+ languages.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Same conceptual frame refined: evidence rejects original positive prediction in favor of null hypothesis
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Reversed primary prediction: phonological density does NOT predict stronger DLM; weak positive correlation found instead
  (r=0.19, p=0.17)
- >-
  Null finding reframed as contribution: establishes phonological density and syntactic optimization as independent constraints
- >-
  Added phylogenetic control requirement: mixed-effects models with family random intercept needed to address 28/55 Indo-European
  sample skew
- >-
  Proposed alternative mechanisms: phonological reduction of adjacent words, increased morphological marking, prosodic-phrase-level
  mediation
- >-
  Specified PPAD metric correction: should sum phonemes of intervening words, not weight by connected-word average phoneme
  count
- >-
  Added sensitivity analysis requirement: test with complete phonological data subsample and distinguish real vs. approximated
  phoneme counts
- >-
  Added requirement to engage with Ferrer-i-Cancho & Gomez-Rodriguez (2021) who tested reverse direction (DLM -> phonological
  compression) using UD treebanks
- >-
  Narrowed scope to cross-linguistic level only; acknowledged that effects may operate at different timescales (diachronic
  phonology vs. synchronic syntax)

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Phonological Density Does Not Predict DLM Strength
hypothesis: >-
  Languages with higher phonological density do not exhibit systematically stronger dependency distance minimization (DLM).
  Cross-linguistic tests across 55 languages from 10 families show no significant relationship between phoneme inventory size
  and mean dependency distance (Spearman r = 0.19, p = 0.17; R² = 0.05), with the weak correlation running opposite to the
  predicted direction. Phonological density and syntactic optimization appear to operate as largely independent constraints
  on linear order. Any residual phonological effect on DLM is likely mediated not by direct compression of syntactic dependencies
  but by alternative compensatory mechanisms: (1) phonological reduction of words adjacent to long-distance dependencies,
  (2) increased morphological marking to clarify grammatical roles without linear proximity, or (3) modulation at the phonological
  phrasing/prosodic interface rather than the syntactic level. The null finding itself constitutes a contribution: it establishes
  that the phonotactic constraint hypothesis — the idea that phonological crowding 'hoards' adjacency slots for syntactic
  optimization — does not hold at the cross-linguistic level. Future tests should (a) control for phylogenetic non-independence
  using mixed-effects models with language family as random intercept, (b) distinguish between phoneme-space span (phonemes
  in intervening words) and phoneme-weighted distance (distance weighted by connected word phoneme counts), and (c) test for
  modality-specific effects using spoken corpora where available.
motivation: >-
  Current dependency distance research suffers from two blindspots: (1) all work uses WORD-SPACE distance, missing phonological
  proximity constraints; (2) no one has tested whether phonological density modulates the strength of syntactic minimization.
  The findings on comparable information rates across speech and writing suggest speakers optimize around channel capacity.
  By shifting the unit of analysis from words to phonemes, this hypothesis joins the phonotactic/phonemic layer with the syntactic
  layer to reveal a cross-layer cost constraint that explains otherwise puzzling cross-linguistic patterns in DLM strength.
assumptions:
- >-
  UD treebanks are comparable across languages for extracting dependency distance patterns
- >-
  Phoneme inventory sizes and syllabification patterns are reliably available in cross-linguistic resources (e.g., Glottolog,
  Lexibank)
- >-
  The interaction between phonological density and syntactic optimization is not confounded by other typological factors (word
  order, distance-based rankings can be controlled)
- >-
  Spoken language treebanks (e.g., read speech, news corpora) sufficiently capture the phonological pressures that drive spoken
  communication efficiency
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Collect UD treebanks (commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace) and phonological density measures for 40+ languages
  (5+ from each of 8 typologically diverse families). 2. Measure dependency distance distributions (mean, variance, tail behavior)
  using the newly proposed phoneme-position adjacency metric: for each dependency hedge-d-dependent span, compute phoneme-position
  difference rather than word-position difference, weighted by constituent phoneme counts. 3. Control for word-order typology
  (OV/SVO/VSO) and overall distance-based rankings from prior work. 4. Test statistical relationship between phonological
  density metric and DLM strength using hierarchical regression: DLM as response, phonological density as primary predictor,
  language family as random effect, word-order as fixed covariate. 5. Cross-validation within language families to control
  for shared history. 6. Secondary analysis: compare how well this explains variance in DLM across modalities where possible.
success_criteria: >-
  The core hypothesis succeeds if: (1) Linguistic regression shows phonological density is a significant positive predictor
  of DLM strength (more dense = stronger minimization), above and beyond word-order typology; (2) The effect holds across
  5+ independent language families; (3) Family-level patterns emerge consistent with drift rather than sampling noise; (4)
  Sensitivity analyses (controlling for syllable count, stress patterns) confirm the phonological effect is not confounded.

  Krielke (2024) - Diachronic shift toward intra-phrasal dependency relations in scientific English and German, hinting at
  phonological-density interaction
inspiration: >-
  Three cross-field insights combined: (1) MODALITY INTEGRITY (Coupé et al. 2019) - Languages optimize structural properties
  around communicative constraints; (2) MULTIMODAL EFFICIENCY (Rasenberg et al. 2022) - Teams minimize joint effort across
  different behavior types; (3) CROSS-LEVEL CONSTRAINT - Phonological density in chemistry/statistics hoards local configuration
  space, limiting elsewhere. The novel mechanism is borrowing the 'constraint competition' principle from materials physics:
  when one constraint type tightly occupies physical space (phonological adjacency), other systems must adapt (syntactic proximity)
  with different strategies. The phoneme-space dependency metric makes this competition observable.
terms:
- term: Dependency distance minimization (DLM)
  definition: >-
    The tendency of syntactically related words (heads and dependents) to be linearly close to each other in a sentence, reducing
    processing cost.
- term: Mean dependency distance (MDD)
  definition: >-
    The average absolute linear distance between heads and dependents, averaged over all dependency arcs in a corpus—currently
    the dominant aggregate DLM metric.
- term: Phonological density
  definition: >-
    A cross-linguistic measure combining phoneme inventory size, phonotactic complexity (legal consonant clusters), and the
    number of distinct syllable types; higher, or is the most widely reported dependency-distance summary.
- term: Phoneme-position adjacency matrix
  definition: >-
    An extension of token-space distance metrics where dependency distances are computed not in word positions but in underlying
    phoneme character positions, weighted by each word's constituent phoneme count.
- term: Functional vs. lexical dependencies
  definition: >-
    A dichotomy from Gerdes (2026): functional dependencies (determiners, case markers, auxiliaries) are universally short
    because grammar 'hard codes' their adjacency; lexical dependencies (subjects, objects, modifiers) are longer and constrained
    by typology.
summary: >-
  A phonotope density hypothesis predicting that languages with denser phonological inventories exhibit stronger dependency
  distance minimization, tested by measuring dependency distance in phoneme-space U wrongmost from HuggingFace and correlating
  DLM strength with phonological density across 40+ languages.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Same conceptual frame refined: evidence rejects original positive prediction in favor of null hypothesis
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Reversed primary prediction: phonological density does NOT predict stronger DLM; weak positive correlation found instead
  (r=0.19, p=0.17)
- >-
  Null finding reframed as contribution: establishes phonological density and syntactic optimization as independent constraints
- >-
  Added phylogenetic control requirement: mixed-effects models with family random intercept needed to address 28/55 Indo-European
  sample skew
- >-
  Proposed alternative mechanisms: phonological reduction of adjacent words, increased morphological marking, prosodic-phrase-level
  mediation
- >-
  Specified PPAD metric correction: should sum phonemes of intervening words, not weight by connected-word average phoneme
  count
- >-
  Added sensitivity analysis requirement: test with complete phonological data subsample and distinguish real vs. approximated
  phoneme counts
- >-
  Added requirement to engage with Ferrer-i-Cancho & Gomez-Rodriguez (2021) who tested reverse direction (DLM -> phonological
  compression) using UD treebanks
- >-
  Narrowed scope to cross-linguistic level only; acknowledged that effects may operate at different timescales (diachronic
  phonology vs. synchronic syntax)

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

### [11] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-09-08 00:07:22 UTC

```
Direction: Computational Linguistics — Dependency Distance Minimization Across UD Treebanks. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that measures dependency-distance distributions across UD treebanks, investigates whether spoken language minimizes more than written, characterizes how typology interacts with the pattern, and identifies families that deviate. MUST use commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace.

Ambition: level 3 of 5 — phenomenological science: surface and rigorously characterize a new empirical regularity or anomaly in the data, even before a full theoretical explanation exists.

Reviewer: I am Kaja Dobrovoljc (JSI / University of Ljubljana). Calibrate from my existing papers. Cross-domain methods (information theory, mixed-effects models, sequence models) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for ACL, EMNLP, or the Computational Linguistics journal. Audience: computational linguists and quantitative typologists. Tone: empirically rigorous, careful with linguistic detail, reproducible on public UD.
