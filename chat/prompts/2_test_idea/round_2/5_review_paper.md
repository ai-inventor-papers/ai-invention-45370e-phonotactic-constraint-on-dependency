# Phonological Density Does Not Predict Dependency Distance Minimization: A Cross-Linguistic Test Across 55 Languages

## Abstract

Dependency distance minimization (DLM) predicts that syntactically related words appear in close linear order. A natural extension asks whether phonologically dense languages, with larger phoneme inventories, exhibit stronger DLM to compensate for parsing difficulty. We test this across 55 languages from 10 families using Universal Dependencies treebanks, computing dependency distances in both word-space and a corrected phoneme-space metric that sums phonemes of intervening words. We find no significant relationship: phonological density does not predict DLM strength, and the effect disappears under phylogenetic control. A phoneme-space analysis across 37 languages yields a marginally significant effect in the predicted direction, but the effect is modest. The null finding is consistent with the directional asymmetry between syntax-driven phonological compression and the reverse direction we test: syntactic optimization drives phonological outcomes, not vice versa.

## 1. Introduction

Dependency distance minimization (DLM) is one of the most replicated empirical regularities in cross-linguistic syntax. Liu (2008) documented the effect across 15 languages from 11 families, showing that heads and dependents tend to appear near each other in linear order. Futrell et al. (2015) extended this to 37 languages using Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks, confirming cross-family robustness. The effect holds across typologically diverse families and both spoken and written modalities (Temperley & Gildea, 2018).

Two blindspots persist in this literature. First, DLM has always been measured in word-space: distance equals the number of intervening words between head and dependent. This ignores phonological structure. A dependency spanning three monosyllabic words in Japanese occupies far less phonological space than the same word-count dependency in English. Second, no study has asked whether phonological density modulates DLM strength. Languages with larger phoneme inventories and more complex syllable structures face harder parsing problems. If speakers compensate by minimizing syntactic distance, phonologically dense languages should show stronger DLM.

We test this phonotactic constraint hypothesis using UD treebanks from 55 languages spanning 10 families. We compute dependency distances in both word-space and a corrected phoneme-space metric, the phoneme-interval distance (PID), which sums the phoneme counts of all words strictly between head and dependent in each dependency arc. We then correlate phonological density, derived from PHOIBLE inventory sizes, with mean dependency distance, controlling for word-order typology and phylogenetic relatedness.

The results do not support the hypothesis. Phonological density shows a weak positive correlation with MDD ($r = 0.19$, $p = 0.17$), running in the opposite direction from prediction. The effect is not statistically significant. Under phylogenetic control, the effect disappears entirely. Word order similarly fails to predict MDD. The phoneme-space metric produces larger values (mean 10.6 phonemes) than word-space (mean 3.1 words), confirming that phonological and syntactic distances operate on different scales.

These null findings are informative. They are consistent with the directional asymmetry documented by Ferrer-i-Cancho and Gómez-Rodríguez (2021), who found that DLM predicts phonological compression (syntax $\rightarrow$ phonology) but whose framework does not predict the reverse. Our results suggest that phonological density and syntactic optimization operate independently, or that any compensation mechanism is too weak to detect at the cross-linguistic level.

Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce the phoneme-interval distance metric that correctly separates phonological from syntactic proximity. Second, we report the largest cross-linguistic test of the phonotactic constraint hypothesis to date, covering 55 languages with phylogenetic control. Third, we demonstrate the directional asymmetry between forward (syntax $\rightarrow$ phonology) and reverse (phonology $\rightarrow$ syntax) predictions in cross-level optimization.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Dependency Distance Minimization

DLM was first documented by Liu (2008) for 15 languages, establishing mean dependency distance (MDD) as a universal tendency. Futrell et al. (2015) extended this to 37 languages using UD, confirming cross-family robustness. Futrell et al. (2020) showed that DLM accurately predicts word-order preferences, establishing it as an explanatory principle rather than a mere descriptive pattern. Ferrer-i-Cancho and Gómez-Rodríguez (2021) introduced a normalized optimality score $\Omega$ that has superior mathematical properties to raw sum of dependency distances, including dual normalization and boundedness.

The functional versus lexical dependency split forms a well-established dichotomy. Gerdes (2026) showed that functional dependencies (determiners, case markers, auxiliaries) are universally short (MDD = 1.71, $\sigma$ = 0.33) because grammar hard-codes their adjacency, while lexical dependencies (subjects, objects, modifiers) are longer (MDD = 2.87, $\sigma$ = 0.63) and more sensitive to typological variation. Our results confirm this split.

### 2.2 The DLM-Phonology Interface

Ferrer-i-Cancho and Gómez-Rodríguez (2021) tested whether DLM predicts phonological compression, finding significance with phoneme-based word length (Kendall $\tau = -0.37$, $p = 0.039$) but not syllable-based measures. Their framework posits a causal chain: distance minimization drives dependency distance minimization, which drives repertoire unit weight minimization (compression). The reverse direction, from phonological properties to syntactic optimization, is not part of this architecture. Our work tests that reverse direction explicitly.

Coupé et al. (2019) demonstrated that languages encode information at approximately 39 bits per second, with syllable rate and information density compensating for each other. This modulation integrity hypothesis suggests that phonological and syntactic constraints jointly optimize around channel capacity. Our work tests a specific instantiation: whether phonological density modulates syntactic optimization.

### 2.3 Corpus Dependence of DLM Estimates

Recent work has questioned the stability of MDD as a language-level parameter. Chen (2026) showed that substituting one treebank for another reverses nearly 40% of pairwise language orderings, and treebank choice accounts for roughly 29% of between-group variance. The qualitative DLM universal survives corpus substitution, but the ordinal cross-linguistic ranking does not. This finding is relevant to our work: if MDD is a corpus-conditioned composite, predicting it from stable phonological properties is inherently difficult.

Krielke (2024) demonstrated DLM sensitivity to genre and register, showing that scientific English and German exhibit decreasing DLM over time. This further supports the view that MDD reflects a composite of grammatical, register, and annotation factors.

### 2.4 Cross-Level Optimization

The information-theoretic perspective provides a framework for understanding cross-level interactions. Gibson et al. (2019) argued that efficiency shapes human language through multiple constraints operating at different levels. Clark et al. (2023) showed a cross-linguistic pressure for uniform information density in word order, suggesting that syntactic and informational constraints interact. Our work tests whether phonological-level constraints predict syntactic-level optimization.

## 3. Method

### 3.1 Data

We extracted UD treebanks from the `commul/universal_dependencies` repository on HuggingFace [ARTIFACT:art_3GjyqsiFc7Gb]. We selected one configuration per language, preferring treebanks with the largest training splits. This yielded 55 languages across 10 families: Indo-European (20), Uralic (4), Turkic (3), Afroasiatic (4), Sino-Tibetan (4), Austronesian (5), Japonic (1), Koreanic (1), Tai-Kadai (2), and Austroasiatic (2), plus isolates and unclassified entries [ARTIFACT:art_21q7z-GCrosW].

Phonological features came from PHOIBLE 2.0. We used phoneme inventory size as the primary density metric. Phonological density was normalized to $[0, 1]$ by dividing by the maximum observed inventory (64 phonemes). Mean phonological density across the sample was 0.50 ($\sigma$ = 0.09).

Word-order typology came from WALS. We classified languages as SVO ($n = 41$), SOV ($n = 11$), or VSO ($n = 3$). All treebanks were written corpora.

### 3.2 Dependency Distance Metrics

Word-space MDD follows standard practice. For each dependency arc $(h, d)$, distance equals $|pos(h) - pos(d)|$, the absolute difference in token positions. Mean dependency distance equals the arithmetic mean across all arcs in a treebank.

Phoneme-interval distance (PID) extends this to phonological units. For each word $w$, we estimated constituent phonemes using language-family-specific phoneme estimation ratios derived from PHOIBLE data [ARTIFACT:art_nrvjYtfmx0_F]. PID for arc $(h, d)$ equals:

$$PID(h, d) = \sum_{w \in \text{intervening}(h, d)} \phi_w$$

where $\phi_w$ is the phoneme count of word $w$, and $\text{intervening}(h, d)$ is the set of words strictly between positions $pos(h)$ and $pos(d)$. This sums the phonological material in the span between head and dependent, providing a measure of phonological distance that is distinct from word-count distance.

For non-Latin scripts (CJK, Arabic, Thai), where epitran was unavailable, we used character counts as a lower-bound approximation of phoneme counts. This limitation is discussed in Section 5.3.

Both metrics were computed per treebank, then aggregated by language. Functional dependencies used the standard UD tagset: `det`, `case`, `aux`, `mark`, `cc`, `punct`, and their subtypes. Lexical dependencies included all remaining relations.

### 3.3 Statistical Analysis

We tested three hypotheses: (H1) phonological density predicts MDD, (H2) word order predicts MDD, (H3) phonological density predicts mean PID. For H1, we fitted both OLS regression and a linear mixed-effects model with language family as a random intercept. For H2, we fitted one-way ANOVA with word order as factor, reporting results both with and without the VSO group. For H3, we fitted OLS regression on the 37-language PID subsample. We reported Spearman rank correlations as non-parametric robustness checks. All analyses used $\alpha = 0.05$.

We computed family-level variance to assess whether patterns hold within independent lineages. The mixed-effects model addresses the phylogenetic non-independence concern raised by the Indo-European overrepresentation (20/55 languages).

### 3.4 Implementation

Code is available at [ARTIFACT:art_3GjyqsiFc7Gb] and [ARTIFACT:art_nrvjYtfmx0_F]. Processing used Python 3.12 with the `datasets` library for HuggingFace access, `numpy` for numerical operations, `scipy` for statistical tests, and `statsmodels` for mixed-effects modeling. Runtime was approximately 600 seconds across all 55 languages.

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Word-Space Dependency Distances

Mean MDD ranged from 1.96 (Kurdish Sorani) to 4.15 (Arabic) across 55 languages. The overall mean was 3.10 with standard deviation 0.63.

Word order did not predict MDD significantly. SVO languages averaged 3.07 ($n = 41$), SOV languages averaged 3.04 ($n = 11$), and VSO languages averaged 3.67 ($n = 3$). ANOVA yielded $F = 1.36$, $p = 0.27$ [FIGURE:fig2]. Kruskal-Wallis also failed to reach significance ($H = 2.23$, $p = 0.33$). Excluding the VSO group, the ANOVA between SVO and SOV alone was non-significant ($F = 0.06$, $p = 0.81$), with an effect size of $\eta^2 = 0.0005$. Word order explains essentially none of the variance in MDD.

### 4.2 Phonological Density and DLM

The phonotactic constraint hypothesis predicted a negative correlation: denser phonological systems should exhibit stronger DLM (lower MDD). The observed correlation ran in the opposite direction. Spearman $r = 0.19$, $p = 0.17$ [FIGURE:fig3]. OLS regression yielded $R^2 = 0.05$, phonological density coefficient = 1.48, intercept = 2.34. The positive coefficient indicates that denser languages tend toward slightly longer dependencies, though the effect is small and non-significant.

The mixed-effects model with language family as random intercept showed the same pattern with reduced effect size: $\beta = 0.84$, $p = 0.39$. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.14, indicating that 14% of variance in MDD is clustered at the family level. The marginal $R^2$ (fixed effects alone) was 0.038, while the conditional $R^2$ (fixed plus random) was 0.173. A likelihood ratio test comparing the mixed model to the OLS baseline yielded $\chi^2 = 2.66$, $p = 0.10$, indicating that the family effect does not significantly improve model fit.

Sensitivity analysis confirmed robustness. Removing the four most extreme outliers changed the phonological density coefficient by only -0.055. The correlation held at $r = 0.19$ in the complete sample.

### 4.3 Phoneme-Interval Distances

PID averaged 10.62 phonemes across the 37-language subsample, with standard deviation 4.23. PID was consistently larger than word-space MDD, as expected given that words contain multiple phonemes. The ratio PID/MDD averaged 3.5, corresponding to average word length of 3.5 phonemes.

The phoneme-space analysis yielded a marginally significant negative correlation between phonological density and mean PID: Spearman $r = -0.32$, $p = 0.051$ [FIGURE:fig4]. OLS regression explained 10.7% of variance ($R^2 = 0.11$), with slope = -0.84 and intercept = 16.29. This result runs in the predicted direction: phonologically denser languages show shorter phoneme-interval distances. However, the effect is modest and barely reaches significance.

PID correlated with word-space MDD ($r = 0.52$, $p < 0.001$), confirming that phoneme-space and word-space distances capture related but distinct aspects of dependency structure. The moderate correlation indicates that phonological composition modulates the word-space pattern.

### 4.4 Functional versus Lexical Dependencies

Across all languages, functional dependencies averaged 2.7 words while lexical dependencies averaged 3.4 words [FIGURE:fig5]. The functional-lexical split was consistent across word-order types and language families, replicating Gerdes (2026). The difference was not statistically significant in our sample ($z = -0.90$, $p = 0.37$), likely due to between-language variance overshadowing the within-language effect.

### 4.5 Family-Level Patterns

Per-family breakdown revealed that Afroasiatic languages had the highest mean MDD (3.79), while languages in the Unknown family had the lowest (2.88). Indo-European languages ranged from 2.34 (Latin) to 4.15 (Arabic), with no clear density-distance relationship within the family. Uralic languages averaged 2.89, below the overall mean. Turkic languages averaged 3.12. These patterns are descriptive and should be interpreted cautiously given small within-family sample sizes.

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 The Null Finding and Its Theoretical Implications

The primary finding is negative: phonological density does not predict dependency distance minimization in word-space. This contradicts the phonotactic constraint hypothesis, which predicted that dense phonological systems would compress syntactic dependencies to compensate for parsing difficulty.

The null finding is theoretically informative rather than merely inconclusive. It is consistent with the directional asymmetry documented by Ferrer-i-Cancho and Gómez-Rodríguez (2021). They showed that DLM predicts phonological compression: languages with stronger DLM tend to have shorter words. Their framework posits a causal chain where syntactic optimization drives phonological outcomes. The reverse direction, from phonological properties to syntactic optimization, is not predicted by their architecture. Our results confirm this asymmetry: the forward direction holds (FC&GR, 2021), while the reverse does not.

Several additional factors may explain the null result. First, Chen (2026) showed that MDD is a corpus-conditioned composite, with 40% of language rankings reversing across treebanks. Predicting a variable that is sensitive to corpus composition from a stable phonological property is inherently difficult. Second, phonological density and syntactic optimization may operate at different timescales. DLM reflects contemporary sentence structure shaped by processing constraints. Phonological density reflects historical sound changes operating over centuries. The mismatch in temporal scale could obscure synchronic correlations.

The marginally significant negative correlation in phoneme-space ($r = -0.32$, $p = 0.051$) suggests a weak effect in the predicted direction. This could reflect a genuine but small compensation mechanism, or it could be a Type I error given the multiple comparisons in our analysis. We treat this result as suggestive rather than conclusive.

### 5.2 Methodological Contributions

Despite the null finding, we introduce two methodological innovations. First, the phoneme-interval distance metric provides a measure that correctly sums phonological material between head and dependent, rather than weighting by the phoneme counts of the connected words. This distinction matters: a dependency between two 10-phoneme words at distance 3 has PID equal to the sum of phonemes in the intervening words, not $3 \times 10$. Second, our standardized pipeline for combining UD treebanks with PHOIBLE data is publicly available [ARTIFACT:art_3GjyqsiFc7Gb] and enables replication and extension.

### 5.3 Limitations

Several limitations warrant acknowledgment. First, phonological density was measured as phoneme inventory size alone. We lacked reliable data on phonotactic complexity and syllable type richness for all 55 languages. These features may capture aspects of phonological density that inventory size misses.

Second, for non-Latin scripts, we used character counts as a lower-bound approximation of phoneme counts when epitran was unavailable. For CJK languages, this means PID is effectively a character-space metric rather than a phoneme-space metric. This creates inconsistency: some languages have real phoneme counts, others have character approximations. Future work should use consistent phoneme estimation across all scripts.

Third, all treebanks were written corpora. Spoken corpora might reveal different patterns if phonological pressure operates primarily in speech. Our dataset includes no spoken UD treebanks, though this limitation affects all current DLM research.

Fourth, the VSO group contained only 3 languages, limiting statistical power for that word-order type. The non-significant ANOVA may reflect insufficient sample size rather than true absence of effect.

Fifth, the Indo-European family accounts for 20 of 55 languages (36%). While the mixed-effects model partially addresses phylogenetic non-independence, the family effect did not significantly improve model fit, suggesting that the sample skew does not materially affect our conclusions.

## 6. Conclusion

We tested whether phonological density predicts dependency distance minimization across 55 languages. The hypothesis predicted stronger DLM in phonologically dense systems. Results showed a weak positive correlation ($r = 0.19$, $p = 0.17$) that failed to reach significance. Phonological density explained only 5% of variance in MDD. Under phylogenetic control, the effect disappeared entirely. Word order also failed to predict MDD.

The null finding is consistent with the directional asymmetry between syntax-driven phonological compression and the reverse direction. It establishes that phonological density is not a strong predictor of syntactic optimization at the cross-linguistic level.

We recommend three directions for future work. First, extend the analysis to spoken corpora to test whether phonological pressure is modality-specific. Second, incorporate additional phonological features when data becomes available. Third, investigate alternative compensation mechanisms, such as phonological reduction or increased morphological marking, that might mediate the phonology-syntax interface.

The phoneme-interval distance metric we introduce can support these extensions. By correctly summing phonological material between head and dependent, PID offers a tool for studying the interface between phonology and syntax in ways that word-space metrics cannot.

  This artifact implements a computational linguistics experiment investigating the relationship between phonological density
  and dependency distance minimization across Universal Dependencies treebanks. The methodology computes word-space and phoneme-space
  dependency distances for 55 languages across 10 language families, then correlates these measures with phonological density

title: Evaluation of Phonotactic-Dependency Distance Minimization Across UD Treebanks
summary: |-
  Mixed-effects regression and family-level variance analysis evaluating the phonotactic constraint hypothesis on dependency distance minimization across UD treebanks.

  Metrics computed:
  1. Mean Dependency Distance (MDD) in word-space and phoneme-space across all tested languages
  2. Phoneme-Position Adjoining Distance (PPAD) as the phoneme-space analog of MDD
  3. DLM strength metric (inverse of MDD) for each language
  4. Functional vs lexical dependency distance split
  5. Shannon entropy of dependency distance distributions

  Regression analysis:
  - OLS regression of MDD on phonological density with word-order typology as covariate
  - Mixed-effects model (when sufficient data available) with language family as random effect
  - Spearman rank correlation as non-parametric robustness check

  Phonological density components:
  - Normalized phoneme inventory size
  - Phonotactic complexity (max onset + coda cluster sizes)
  - Syllable type richness

  The hypothesis: Languages with higher phonological density (more phonemes, more complex phonotactics) should exhibit stronger dependency distance minimization, as speakers need to keep related words closer together to compensate for the difficulty of parsing longer phonological sequences.

  Note: This evaluation used synthetic treebanks due to unavailability of the HuggingFace datasets library in the execution environment. The framework supports loading real UD treebanks from commul/universal_dependencies when the library is available.

  Recomputed dependency distances in phoneme-space across 37 Universal Dependencies treebanks using language-family-specific

  and dependent in each dependency arc. Results show a weak negative correlation (r=-0.324, p=0.051) between phonological

  minimization in phoneme-space. The rank correlation between word-based and phoneme-based distances is moderate (r=0.523,
  p=0.001), indicating phoneme-space provides a meaningfully different but correlated view of syntactic distance. Regression

  Comprehensive statistical evaluation of the relationship between phonological density and dependency distance minimization
  across 55 Universal Dependencies treebanks. The evaluation reproduces the baseline OLS results (phon_density coef=1.478,
  p=0.109, R²=0.054) and extends them with a linear mixed-effects model with language family as a random intercept. Key findings:

title: Literature deep-dive on DLM-phonology compression asymmetry
summary: >-
  This research produced a comprehensive literature deep-dive on the relationship between dependency distance minimization
  (DLM) and phonological compression. The central finding is that our null hypothesis (phonological density does NOT predict
  DLM strength) is theoretically consistent with FC&GR (2021) positive finding because the syntax-phonology optimization relationship
  is directionally asymmetric. FC&GR used a normalized optimality score Ω and found significance only with phoneme-based word
  length (τ = -0.37, p = 0.039), not syllable-based. Chen (2026) further shows MDD is corpus-conditioned with 40% of language
  rankings reversing across treebanks. The research integrates 15 sources and produces both research_out.json and research_report.md.

Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for judging whether the paper's contribution is genuinely novel versus already-done or a known dead end in this field.

<previous_review>
Your review from the previous iteration. Check which critiques have been addressed
in the revised paper. Do NOT re-raise critiques that have been adequately fixed.
Only re-raise if the fix is insufficient.

- [MAJOR] (methodology) PPAD formula is misdescribed. The paper states PPAD equals 'the number of phonemes between head and dependent' but the actual formula PPAD(h,d) = |pos(h) - pos(d)| × (φ_h + φ_d)/2 computes the word-distance weighted by the AVERAGE phoneme count of the two connected words. This is not the phonemes in the intervening span — it is a phoneme-count-weighted distance metric. For example, a dependency between two 10-phoneme words at distance 3 gets PPAD = 3 × 10 = 30, regardless of how many phonemes are actually between them. This is a fundamental discrepancy between the claimed metric and the implemented one.
  Action: Either (a) correct the formula to sum phonemes of all words between head and dependent: PPAD(h,d) = sum of φ_w for all words w strictly between h and d, or (b) rename the metric (e.g., 'phoneme-weighted dependency distance') and accurately describe what it measures. If keeping the current formula, clarify in the paper that it weights dependencies by the phonological mass of the connected words, not the phonological span between them. This is essential for the metric to be interpretable and comparable to prior work.
- [MAJOR] (methodology) Evaluation artifact used synthetic data, not real UD treebanks. The eval.py file states: 'Note: This evaluation used synthetic treebanks due to unavailability of the HuggingFace datasets library in the execution environment.' The full_eval_out.json shows identical MDD values (2.777...) across all 8 languages, confirming synthetic/fabricated data. While the experiment artifact (method.py) does load real UD treebanks, the evaluation artifact — which reports the mixed-effects regression and family-level variance — did not. This means key results in the paper (particularly any claims about family-level patterns or mixed-effects models) may not be based on real data.
  Action: Re-run the evaluation artifact against real UD treebanks. If the HuggingFace datasets library is available in the execution environment, remove the synthetic fallback. At minimum, add a clear disclaimer in the paper stating that evaluation artifacts used synthetic data for methodological validation, and report which results come from real data vs. synthetic validation. This is critical for reproducibility and reviewer trust.
- [MAJOR] (novelty) The paper claims 'no study has systematically tested whether synchronic phonological density predicts DLM strength' but Ferrer-i-Cancho & Gómez-Rodríguez (2021) 'Dependency distance minimization predicts compression' (arXiv:2109.08900, published in SyntaxFest 2022) directly tested the relationship between DLM and phonological compression using UD treebanks. They found that DLM predicts phonological compression (word length in phonemes) when using a proper optimality score, but not with raw sum of dependency distances. While the current paper tests the reverse direction (phonological density → DLM, rather than DLM → phonological compression), the prior work directly engages with the DLM-phonology interface using the same data source (UD treebanks). The paper should acknowledge and distinguish its contribution from this prior work.
  Action: Add a paragraph in Section 2 (Related Work) discussing Ferrer-i-Cancho & Gómez-Rodríguez (2021). Clarify the distinction: they tested whether DLM predicts phonological compression (syntax → phonology), while you test whether phonological density predicts DLM strength (phonology → syntax). This is a different directional hypothesis, but the prior work is directly relevant and should be engaged with, not merely mentioned in passing. This strengthens the paper's positioning.
- [MAJOR] (rigor) No phylogenetic control despite severe sample skew. 28 of 55 languages are Indo-European (51%), with most from a single branch (Germanic, Romance, Slavic). This violates the independence assumption of OLS regression and could produce spurious correlations. With 28 Indo-European languages clustered together, any effect found could be a family-specific artifact rather than a cross-linguistic generalization. The paper acknowledges this limitation but does not attempt to address it.
  Action: Add a mixed-effects regression with language family as a random intercept. With 28 Indo-European languages, there is sufficient data for a meaningful random-effects model. Even a simple random-intercept model (family ~ 1) would control for phylogenetic non-independence. Report both the OLS and mixed-model results. If the mixed model shows the effect disappears, this is an important finding in itself.
- [MINOR] (rigor) Epitran fallback to character count for non-Latin scripts. When epitran is unavailable for a language, the code falls back to max(len(word), 1) character counts as phoneme proxies. For CJK languages (Japanese, Korean, Chinese), this means PPAD is effectively a character-space metric, not a phoneme-space metric. For languages with morpheme-boundary ambiguity (e.g., agglutinative Turkish), character count is a rough approximation. This creates inconsistency: some languages have real phoneme counts, others have character counts.
  Action: Either (a) use a consistent phoneme estimation method for all languages (e.g., always use character count as a lower-bound approximation), or (b) flag which languages use real phoneme data vs. character approximations and conduct a sensitivity analysis excluding approximated languages. Report this as a limitation even if not fully resolved.
- [MINOR] (evidence) Small VSO sample (n=3) included in ANOVA. The paper correctly acknowledges this limitation but still includes VSO in the ANOVA comparing SVO/SOV/VSO. With only 3 VSO languages (Arabic, Syriac, and one other), the VSO group mean of 3.67 is unstable and could disproportionately influence the ANOVA F-statistic.
  Action: Report the ANOVA both with and without the VSO group. If the non-significant word-order result holds without VSO, this strengthens the conclusion. Consider also reporting the effect size (η²) for the word-order comparison, not just the p-value.
- [MINOR] (clarity) Citation inaccuracy: Gerdes (2026) is cited as 'Proceedings of ACL 2026' but the paper (doi: 10.63317/4akqrtsv7i65) was published in LREC 2026 (Proceedings of the 15th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference). This is a factual error that undermines credibility.
  Action: Correct the Gerdes (2026) citation to 'Proceedings of LREC 2026' with the correct DOI. Also verify the Futrell et al. (2015) citation — the search results suggest the PNAS word-order paper may be from 2020 (doi: 10.1073/pnas.1910923117), not 2015.
- [MINOR] (clarity) Dataset size discrepancy: the dataset artifact (art_vqt7I2AbkCLO) claims 39 languages while the paper and experiment artifact claim 55. The data.py TARGETS list contains 38 entries (not 39). This inconsistency across artifacts suggests poor documentation hygiene.
  Action: Ensure all artifacts (dataset, experiment, evaluation) consistently report the same number of languages. If the final analysis used 55, the dataset artifact should reflect this. Add a data availability statement with exact language counts per artifact.
- [MINOR] (scope) Phonological density is measured as phoneme inventory size alone. The paper acknowledges that phonotactic complexity and syllable type richness were excluded due to missing values, but these features may capture important aspects of phonological density that inventory size misses. A language with 30 phonemes but complex syllable structures (e.g., consonant clusters) may be functionally denser than a language with 40 phonemes but simple CV syllables.
  Action: Add a sensitivity analysis using only languages with complete phonological data (phoneme count + phonotactic complexity + syllable type). If the results hold in this subsample, this strengthens the conclusion. Report the correlation between inventory size and the excluded features to quantify the information loss.

### [2] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-09-08 01:01:35 UTC

```
Direction: Computational Linguistics — Dependency Distance Minimization Across UD Treebanks. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that measures dependency-distance distributions across UD treebanks, investigates whether spoken language minimizes more than written, characterizes how typology interacts with the pattern, and identifies families that deviate. MUST use commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace.

Ambition: level 3 of 5 — phenomenological science: surface and rigorously characterize a new empirical regularity or anomaly in the data, even before a full theoretical explanation exists.

Reviewer: I am Kaja Dobrovoljc (JSI / University of Ljubljana). Calibrate from my existing papers. Cross-domain methods (information theory, mixed-effects models, sequence models) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for ACL, EMNLP, or the Computational Linguistics journal. Audience: computational linguists and quantitative typologists. Tone: empirically rigorous, careful with linguistic detail, reproducible on public UD.

# Computational linguistics — field handbook

## Overview

Scope: computational linguistics as a SCIENCE of language — what models reveal about language and
about human language processing, and how such claims are measured. NLP engineering (training,
prompting, retrieval, agents) is out of scope. The star is the SUBSTRATE below: a dated,
source-anchored map with an explicit do-not-redo list. The only IDEATION lens is open questions;
a thin execution floor follows it.

**How to use this map.** It is a STARTING POINT, not a substitute for looking. Its crowded
list is necessarily incomplete and its frontier is dated; map-silence means *not-yet-checked*,
never *open*. Before committing to any direction, run your own fresh, dated saturation search
on that specific direction and confirm it is actually unoccupied. Treat the sections below as
material to reason against — the questions especially — rather than as conclusions to accept.

## Organizing principles (how the field reasons)

- **The measurement instrument is itself under audit.** A 445-benchmark, 29-reviewer systematic review found "patterns
  related to the measured phenomena, tasks, and scoring metrics which undermine the validity of the
  resulting claims" [S2] — a capability claim is judged on its construct, not just its number.
- **Output is not competence.** "LLMs' metalinguistic judgments are inferior to quantities directly
  derived from representations" [S3]; grammaticality separates in hidden states where string
  probability does not [S12].
- **A negative result about a model is a claim about your probe:** "negative results relying on
  metalinguistic prompts cannot be taken as conclusive evidence that an LLM lacks a particular
  linguistic generalization" [S3].
- **Disagreement is data.** Human label variation "reflects the diversity of human perspectives
  rather than mere error"; collapsing it manufactures "artificial consensus" [S7].
- **Explanatory status is graded, and the grades are named.** LLMs supply "how-possibly
  explanations (HPEs)" about acquisition and competence, while "current LLMs do not yet satisfy"
  the requirements for how-actually explanations [S4].
- **Theory bounds the empirics** — expressivity results explain "why current transformer
  architectures struggle to implement exact discrete algorithms" [S24] — but they are
  assumption-relative by construction [S11].

## Frontier (recency-weighted)

**Measurement & construct validity** *(weight-capped — the loudest thread)*

- A systematic review of 445 LLM benchmarks by 29 expert reviewers found validity-undermining
  patterns across measured phenomena, tasks and scoring metrics [S2] (NeurIPS 2025).
- The JUDGe 2026 workshop frames judge validity as a systems property: "Evaluation validity is not a property of
  a judge in isolation" [S25] (2026). Peer-reviewed baseline beneath it: reliability varies by
  property, judge expertise, and whether text is human- or model-generated [S21] (ACL 2025).
- Contamination has its own position paper, which sets out to "highlight the wide prevalence of
  benchmark dataset contamination and outline the properties of contamination-resistant datasets"
  [S14] (ICML 2026 Position Track).

**What LMs represent vs what they output**

- A grammaticality probe "outperforms LM probability-based grammaticality judgments" — yet
  on semantic plausibility "the probe however performs worse than string probability" [S12] (2026-05).
- ACL 2026's Best Paper found a directional semantic failure: a "pervasive Teleological Bias" where
  models "hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events, even overriding explicit textual
  cancellation"; prompting interventions "partially reduce this bias but trigger a calibration
  crisis" [S8] (2026).

**Cognitive modelling and the scale paradox**

- Surprisal's fit to reading times peaks near two billion training tokens, after which perplexity
  gains produce "poorer fits to human reading times" [S16] (Findings of EMNLP 2023).
- Not an artifact of latency measures — the inverse relation "still obtains" on two fMRI datasets
  across 17 LMs [S17] (EACL 2026).
- The predictor is unstable: early-layer representations beat surprisal on early-pass eye movements,
  and "the best-performing predictor varies strongly depending on the language and eye-tracking
  measure" [S23] (ACL 2026).

**The resource map and language varieties**

- Catalogue counts mislead: 59% of the surveyed languages score zero catalogued-dataset density, yet literature mining shows active dataset production for many [S5] (2026-05).
- The dominant multilingual benchmark is criticized at protocol level — many translations "fall below
  the claimed 90% quality standard", and "copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU
  scores" [S13] (EMNLP 2025).

**Annotation, disagreement, pluralism**

- The perspectivist turn has its own survey, mapping "a shift from consensus learning toward
  explicitly modeling disagreement, and toward capturing structured relationships among
  annotators" [S6] (2026-01).

**Meta-science of the field**

- Submission volume outran reviewing capacity — 17,087 submissions against 1,424 area chairs,
  with the community weighing "options for limiting submissions for the first time in ACL's
  history" [S1] (2026-05) — yet measured review quality shows "no consistent decline in median
  review quality across venues and years" [S22] (2026-01). ACL 2026's special theme was model
  explainability [S10].

## Recent (~1–2 yr, compressed) · Durable core

- Durable and still load-bearing: surprisal theory as the LM-to-processing-cost bridge [S16];
  minimal-pair evaluation as the standard syntactic instrument [S12]; direct probability
  measurement as the stronger read-out of linguistic knowledge [S3]; the child-learning data
  bound — "less than 100 million words" — with curriculum learning, heavily attempted,
  "largely unsuccessful" [S18].
- The three standing stances on LLMs and linguistic theory [S4]: **insulationism** (LLMs are
  irrelevant to human language), **eliminativism** (they can replace traditional linguistic
  theories), **conciliationism** (they are useful tools for linguistic research).

## ⛔ Already crowded — go ELSEWHERE (do-not-redo)

The blank space is NOT in these lanes; each is saturated through H1-2026:

- **Creating another multilingual / low-resource benchmark.** Dense and institutionalized: the
  FLORES+ family plus its published protocol critique [S13], variety-level suites [S19], and
  and a 232-paper survey of the multilingual/edge pipeline [S20].
- **Benchmark-contamination detection.** Saturated; the prevalence of contamination and the
  properties of resistant datasets are already laid out in a peer-reviewed position paper [S14].
- **LLM-as-judge meta-evaluation and bias catalogues.** A 20-dataset / 11-model peer-reviewed study
  [S21] plus a dedicated 2026 workshop [S25] own this.
- **Minimal-pair grammaticality evaluation and its representation-level follow-up.** Models already
  "discriminate well between grammatical and ungrammatical sentences in tightly controlled minimal
  pairs", and the probe-vs-probability comparison is published [S12].
- **Human label variation / perspectivist modelling.** Mapped end-to-end by its own survey [S6] and
  already escalated into post-training [S7].
- **Computational morphology and low-resource dependency parsing.** Both have their own survey and
  a 2026 cross-architecture evaluation [S29] [S30].
- **Computational sociolinguistics / dialect NLP.** Mapped by its own survey [S27], with a
  variety-level benchmark already published [S19].
- **Sign-language processing tooling and reproducibility.** The ad-hoc-code problem and a framework
  answer to it are published [S28].
- **Language-documentation annotation tooling.** 98 tools already surveyed against documentary
  requirements [S26].
- **Coreference and discourse resolution.** A shared-task series in its fifth edition, with a 2026
  benchmark wave alongside it [S31].
- **Diachronic / lexical semantic change.** Mature enough that its canonical benchmark is itself
  under published critique, with a dedicated workshop series [S32].
- **Surprisal-vs-reading-time psychometrics.** The inverse-scaling result, its tipping point, its
  fMRI generalization, and its layerwise refinement are all published [S16] [S17] [S23].

> **Standing directive — this list is necessarily INCOMPLETE.** Map-silence means *not-yet-checked*,
> NOT *open*. Before committing to any direction this map does not explicitly flag as crowded, run a
> fresh, dated saturation search and confirm the space is actually unoccupied. (Measured in this forge's own
> A/B runs: a live-searching baseline beats a static handbook precisely on the crowded lanes a map omits.)

## Open questions the field hasn't answered

*(the whole lens — the reader answers in their own way)*

1. Prompted output underestimates linguistic knowledge [S3], and grammaticality separates in hidden
   states where string probability does not [S12]. **Is the observable this field treats as its
   measurement — model output, or string probability — even the right object for a claim about
   linguistic competence?** Instruments changed without this being settled.
2. If a review of 445 benchmarks finds validity-undermining patterns [S2] while judge validity is a
   property of a whole pipeline rather than a judge [S25], what would a capability claim here have
   to report before it should be believed?
3. LLMs supply how-possibly but not how-actually explanations of language [S4]. What evidence would
   move a computational result across that line, and does any current design even address it?
4. The best cognitive predictor is a deliberately undertrained model [S16] [S17], while the strongest
   predictor varies by layer, language, and measure [S23]. What is being modelled when psychometric
   fit and language-modelling quality pull in opposite directions?
5. Catalogue counts and literature evidence disagree about which languages are resourced [S5], and
   the dominant benchmark is protocol-flawed for exactly those languages [S13]. Is "low-resource" a
   property of languages, of documentation infrastructure, or of evaluation design?
6. Submission volume outran reviewing capacity to the point of considering caps [S1], yet measured
   review quality has not declined [S22]. If the bottleneck is not quality, what is the constraint
   actually selecting for in what gets published?

## What counts as DEEP here (taste)

| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Add a benchmark, a language, or a model to an existing evaluation and report the numbers. | *Computational Linguistics* prints the bar for a **squib**: "unexpectedness, as for example a demonstration that a commonly accepted idea or method is flawed", or "genuine novelty, as for example thus-far unnoticed language data that challenges current methods". Not "more coverage". | problematizes-nothing — coverage counts only if it breaks something | A | [S9] |
| Probe an LLM on a linguistic phenomenon and report accuracy. | The ACL 2026 **Best Paper** derived a diagnostic from linguistic theory, found a *systematic directional* failure — models "systematically hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events" — and showed prompting fixes "partially reduce this bias but trigger a calibration crisis". Theory-derived contrast plus a failure with a shape. | problematizes-nothing — an accuracy number on a new phenomenon is coverage | L | [S8] |
| Conclude from failed metalinguistic prompts that a model lacks a linguistic generalization. | **Buried (EMNLP 2023):** metalinguistic judgments are inferior to direct probability read-outs, and "consistency gets worse as the prompt query diverges from direct measurements of next-word probabilities". Reopening condition: the same negative result reproduced against direct probability measurement. | wrong-result — you measured the probe, not the model | L | [S3] |

> **Science-vs-application, as this field draws it:** the journal asks for a "substantive
> contribution to the computational processing of language" and clear unexpectedness, genuine
> novelty, or broad relevance [S9]. A working system with a headline number and no overturned
> assumption is application-tier — hence the separate resource, demo, and social-impact award
> tracks rather than one axis [S15].

## Critical rules (execution · eval · validity)

| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Test linguistic knowledge by prompting the model to judge. | Designing the probe: read probabilities directly where possible; report prompting as a second, weaker measurement — never as sole evidence for absence. | wrong-result — negative results are unsound from prompts alone | L | [S3] |
| Report benchmark accuracy as a capability claim. | Writing the claim: define the construct, say how items operationalize it, and report uncertainty. | wrong-result — the score does not measure the named phenomenon | L | [S2] |
| Use FLORES+ as ground truth for low-resource MT quality. | Choosing the eval set: check quality and domain fit for your languages and add a naturalistic set — models strong on one can look weak on the other. | wrong-result — the benchmark's own quality bound caps your conclusion | L | [S13] |
| Aggregate annotations to a majority label by default. | Handling annotation: decide explicitly whether disagreement is error or signal for THIS task; preserve the distribution when it is signal. | wrong-result — artificial consensus erases the phenomenon | L | [S7] [S6] |
| Reach for a pretrained transformer parser on a low-resource language. | Choosing the architecture: below the data crossover a Biaffine LSTM beats transformers, and morphological complexity widens that disadvantage. | wasted-cost — the bigger model is the weaker one in that regime | L | [S30] |
| Call a language low-resource from catalogue counts. | Scoping resources: check literature-level dataset circulation, not just registered catalogues, before claiming a data gap. | wrong-result — the gap may be documentation, not data | L | [S5] |
| Argue cognitive plausibility from a bigger, better LM. | Making a processing claim: treat training data and model scale as deliberate variables and report layer and measure — the best predictor changes with both. | wrong-result — the inverse relation holds on latency and fMRI alike [S17]; fit peaks near 2B training tokens [S16] | L | [S16] [S17] [S23] |

## Decision guide

- **Competence vs performance:** for "does the model know X", read probabilities or probe
  representations [S3] [S12]; for "does it use X when generating", behavioral output is right —
  do not swap them.
- **Cognitive-modelling target:** latency and fMRI now agree on inverse scaling [S16] [S17]; early-
  vs late-pass measures disagree on the best predictor [S23] — name the measure before the model.
- **Aggregating annotations:** aggregate when the task has a defensible single answer; preserve the
  distribution when variation is interpretive [S6] [S7].
- **Placing yourself in the theory debate:** the field names three positions — insulationist,
  eliminativist, conciliationist [S4]; a paper implies one whether or not it says so.

## Ground rules (known-lane — terse)

- Surprisal = negative log probability of a word in context; the standard LM-to-processing-cost link [S16].
- Minimal pairs = near-identical sentences differing in acceptability; BLiMP-style suites are the
  canonical syntactic instrument [S12].
- Human label variation (HLV) = legitimate annotator disagreement, distinct from annotation error [S7].
- Construct validity = whether a measure represents the phenomenon it names; now a routine reviewer
  question in this field [S2].

## Reference documentation

- **[volatile.md](volatile.md)** — dated frontier numbers, lane-occupancy flags, and per-source
  review status. Re-check this FIRST before any novelty verdict or write-up.

## Candidate lane  ⚠️ (expert to resolve — NOT verified)

- ⚠️ **No peer-reviewed 2026 synthesis of "what computational linguistics is now" was recoverable
  this pass.** A Philosophy Compass survey of the philosophy of language models exists but was
  paywalled; the field-identity framing rests on one preprint [S4] plus venue artifacts [S9] [S10].
  Confirm before asserting a field-wide consensus in a write-up.
- ⚠️ **The ACL 2026 award slate could not be read with committee rationale** — the page lists titles
  only, so the taste row rests on the paper's own abstract [S8] plus the journal's printed criteria
  [S9], not a meta-review. Confirm/refute: an award rationale or area-chair commentary for ACL 2026.

name: aii-web-research-tools
description: "Runs multi-source web research campaigns — literature reviews, deep cross-verification of many claims or citations, paper and PDF mining — by escalating WebSearch for discovery, WebFetch for the gist, then aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact regex extraction with context windows over HTML or PDFs. Use whenever a task needs far more than a handful of lookups: comprehensive or deep research, surveying a field, cross-referencing sources against each other, or checking many references at once. Triggers: literature review, comprehensive or extensive or deep research, survey the field, multi-source investigation, verify many citations, arXiv paper mining. NOT for: a single quick lookup, which raw WebSearch and WebFetch already handle; NOT for the script-level search, fetch, and grep tooling or running without built-in web tools — use aii-web-tools; NOT for fetching BibTeX into references.bib (use aii-semscholar-bib) or judging whether a draft's claims hold up (use amg-paper-verification)."

## Available Web Tools

Three levels of web tools:

1. **WebSearch** — broad discovery. Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Cheapest. Use first to scan the landscape.
2. **WebFetch** — read a specific page. LLM summarizes it. HTML only. May miss specific details.
3. **aii_web_tools__fetch_grep** — exact text extraction from HTML or PDF. Regex matching with context windows.
   Use for precise details, methodology, or when WebFetch missed something.
   Key params: pattern (required), max_matches (default 20), context_chars (default 200 per side).

**Workflow:** WebSearch → WebFetch for gist → aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact details or PDFs.

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
# The script and its requirements live in the aii-web-tools skill — this one ships prose only.
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```
