<hypothesis>
Your strategy should advance this hypothesis.

kind: hypothesis
title: Phonotactic Constraint on Dependency Distance
hypothesis: >-
  Languages with phonologically dense inventories (higher phoneme-to-syllable ratio, more complex phonotactics) exhibit stronger
  dependency distance minimization than languages with sparse inventories. The phonological constraint of tight adjacency
  in dense systems effectively 'hoards' close proximity slots that would otherwise be free for syntactic dependency optimization.
motivation: >-
  Current dependency distance research suffers from two blindspots: (1) all work uses WORD-SPACE distance, missing phonological
  proximity constraints; (2) no one has tested whether phonological density modulates the strength of syntactic minimization.
  The findings on comparable information rates across speech and writing suggest speakers optimize around channel capacity.
  By shifting the unit of analysis from words to phonemes, this hypothesis joins the phonotactic/phonemic layer with the syntactic
  layer to reveal a cross-layer cost constraint that explains otherwise puzzling cross-linguistic patterns in DLM strength.
assumptions:
- >-
  UD treebanks are comparable across languages for extracting dependency distance patterns
- >-
  Phoneme inventory sizes and syllabification patterns are reliably available in cross-linguistic resources (e.g., Glottolog,
  Lexibank)
- >-
  The interaction between phonological density and syntactic optimization is not confounded by other typological factors (word
  order, distance-based rankings can be controlled)
- >-
  Spoken language treebanks (e.g., read speech, news corpora) sufficiently capture the phonological pressures that drive spoken
  communication efficiency
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Collect UD treebanks (commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace) and phonological density measures for 40+ languages
  (5+ from each of 8 typologically diverse families). 2. Measure dependency distance distributions (mean, variance, tail behavior)
  using the newly proposed phoneme-position adjacency metric: for each dependency hedge-d-dependent span, compute phoneme-position
  difference rather than word-position difference, weighted by constituent phoneme counts. 3. Control for word-order typology
  (OV/SVO/VSO) and overall distance-based rankings from prior work. 4. Test statistical relationship between phonological
  density metric and DLM strength using hierarchical regression: DLM as response, phonological density as primary predictor,
  language family as random effect, word-order as fixed covariate. 5. Cross-validation within language families to control
  for shared history. 6. Secondary analysis: compare how well this explains variance in DLM across modalities where possible.
success_criteria: >-
  The core hypothesis succeeds if: (1) Linguistic regression shows phonological density is a significant positive predictor
  of DLM strength (more dense = stronger minimization), above and beyond word-order typology; (2) The effect holds across
  5+ independent language families; (3) Family-level patterns emerge consistent with drift rather than sampling noise; (4)
  Sensitivity analyses (controlling for syllable count, stress patterns) confirm the phonological effect is not confounded.

- >-
  Futrell et al. (2015, 2020) - UD-based validation of DLM, expanded language coverage to 37+ languages
- >-

  patterns

  cost structure
- >-
  Kaja Dobrovoljc (2026, 'How Much Does Corpus Choice Change Dependency-Distance Estimates') - Showed ordinal rankings are
  unstable across treebanks, MDD is corpus-conditioned composite
- >-
  Coupé et al. (2019, Science Advances) - All languages encode information at ~39 bits/s, structural properties and processing
  adapt together to channel capacity
- >-
  Ferrer-i-Cancho (2021, 'Dependency distance minimization predicts compression') - Second-order prediction: DLM predicts
  word-length minimization
- >-
  Krielke (2024) - Diachronic shift toward intra-phrasal dependency relations in scientific English and German, hinting at
  phonological-density interaction
inspiration: >-
  Three cross-field insights combined: (1) MODALITY INTEGRITY (Coupé et al. 2019) - Languages optimize structural properties
  around communicative constraints; (2) MULTIMODAL EFFICIENCY (Rasenberg et al. 2022) - Teams minimize joint effort across
  different behavior types; (3) CROSS-LEVEL CONSTRAINT - Phonological density in chemistry/statistics hoards local configuration
  space, limiting elsewhere. The novel mechanism is borrowing the 'constraint competition' principle from materials physics:
  when one constraint type tightly occupies physical space (phonological adjacency), other systems must adapt (syntactic proximity)
  with different strategies. The phoneme-space dependency metric makes this competition observable.
terms:
- term: Dependency distance minimization (DLM)
  definition: >-
    The tendency of syntactically related words (heads and dependents) to be linearly close to each other in a sentence, reducing
    processing cost.
- term: Mean dependency distance (MDD)
  definition: >-
    The average absolute linear distance between heads and dependents, averaged over all dependency arcs in a corpus—currently
    the dominant aggregate DLM metric.
- term: Phonological density
  definition: >-
    A cross-linguistic measure combining phoneme inventory size, phonotactic complexity (legal consonant clusters), and the
    number of distinct syllable types; higher, or is the most widely reported dependency-distance summary.
- term: Phoneme-position adjacency matrix
  definition: >-
    An extension of token-space distance metrics where dependency distances are computed not in word positions but in underlying
    phoneme character positions, weighted by each word's constituent phoneme count.
- term: Functional vs. lexical dependencies
  definition: >-
    A dichotomy from Gerdes (2026): functional dependencies (determiners, case markers, auxiliaries) are universally short
    because grammar 'hard codes' their adjacency; lexical dependencies (subjects, objects, modifiers) are longer and constrained
    by typology.
summary: >-
  A phonotope density hypothesis predicting that languages with denser phonological inventories exhibit stronger dependency
  distance minimization, tested by measuring dependency distance in phoneme-space U wrongmost from HuggingFace and correlating
  DLM strength with phonological density across 40+ languages.

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for study design, proper baselines, and the evaluation/validity norms this field demands.

<dependency_rules>
- depends_on is a list of objects {id, label} — each entry references an existing artifact and tags how it is being used
- "id" can ONLY reference IDs from <existing_artifacts> — never IDs you are proposing (all new artifacts run in parallel)
- "label" is a SHORT free-text type label (a word or two, NOT a sentence) describing what role the dep plays — e.g. "dataset", "validates", "extends", "supersedes". Required on every dep.
- Setting depends_on provides the dependency's out_dependency_files to your artifact at execution time
- If no suitable existing artifacts exist, use empty depends_on
- New artifact IDs are assigned by the system after submission — do not invent IDs for your proposed artifacts

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead

EVALUATION executor scope:
  Output: eval_out.json with evaluation results
  DOES: Any evaluation of experiment results — metrics, statistical tests, ablations, comparisons, visualizations, robustness checks, error analysis, etc.
  DOES NOT: Implement new methods (use EXPERIMENT), collect data (use DATASET)
  This is for analyzing experiment outputs from any angle

PROOF executor scope:
  Output: Lean 4 proof files (.lean) with verified theorems
  DOES: Write and verify Lean 4 formal proofs with Mathlib, iterative compilation
  DOES NOT: Run Python experiments, collect data, do empirical analysis
  Use only when formal mathematical guarantees are needed
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
EVALUATION: Must depend on at least one EXPERIMENT. Focus on statistical rigor and validity checks.
PROOF: Use only when the hypothesis requires formal mathematical guarantees. Lean 4 + Mathlib.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<existing_artifacts>
None yet (first iteration).
</existing_artifacts>





<task>
Generate 1 research strategy for THIS iteration.

**ARTIFACT LIMIT: Each strategy may contain AT MOST 3 artifact directions.** Focus on the highest-impact artifacts. Quality over quantity.

Each strategy should:
1. Define a clear OBJECTIVE - what novel contribution we're building toward
2. Plan artifacts to execute NOW - specify type, objective, approach, and depends_on for each
3. Account for parallel execution - all strategies and all planned artifacts run simultaneously, their artifacts are combined into one shared pool

**BROADER IS NOT THE SAME AS DEEPER.** Adding models, datasets, or settings to
an experiment that already ran makes the table bigger; it does not make the
contribution stronger, and it is the default a strategy generator drifts into
when it has nothing sharper to propose. Spend an artifact on scale only when
the SPREAD itself is the finding (a scaling trend, a regime boundary, a
generalisation claim the paper actually makes). Otherwise spend it on
something that could change the conclusion: the mechanism behind an observed
effect, the condition under which it disappears, the confound that would
explain it away, or the baseline whose absence a reviewer would name first.

### [2] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-09-07 21:47:15 UTC

```
Direction: Computational Linguistics — Dependency Distance Minimization Across UD Treebanks. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that measures dependency-distance distributions across UD treebanks, investigates whether spoken language minimizes more than written, characterizes how typology interacts with the pattern, and identifies families that deviate. MUST use commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace.

Ambition: level 3 of 5 — phenomenological science: surface and rigorously characterize a new empirical regularity or anomaly in the data, even before a full theoretical explanation exists.

Reviewer: I am Kaja Dobrovoljc (JSI / University of Ljubljana). Calibrate from my existing papers. Cross-domain methods (information theory, mixed-effects models, sequence models) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for ACL, EMNLP, or the Computational Linguistics journal. Audience: computational linguists and quantitative typologists. Tone: empirically rigorous, careful with linguistic detail, reproducible on public UD.

<hypothesis>
Your strategy should advance this hypothesis.

kind: hypothesis
title: Phonotactic Constraint on Dependency Distance
hypothesis: >-
  Languages with phonologically dense inventories (higher phoneme-to-syllable ratio, more complex phonotactics) exhibit stronger
  dependency distance minimization than languages with sparse inventories. The phonological constraint of tight adjacency
  in dense systems effectively 'hoards' close proximity slots that would otherwise be free for syntactic dependency optimization.
motivation: >-
  Current dependency distance research suffers from two blindspots: (1) all work uses WORD-SPACE distance, missing phonological
  proximity constraints; (2) no one has tested whether phonological density modulates the strength of syntactic minimization.
  The findings on comparable information rates across speech and writing suggest speakers optimize around channel capacity.
  By shifting the unit of analysis from words to phonemes, this hypothesis joins the phonotactic/phonemic layer with the syntactic
  layer to reveal a cross-layer cost constraint that explains otherwise puzzling cross-linguistic patterns in DLM strength.
assumptions:
- >-
  UD treebanks are comparable across languages for extracting dependency distance patterns
- >-
  Phoneme inventory sizes and syllabification patterns are reliably available in cross-linguistic resources (e.g., Glottolog,
  Lexibank)
- >-
  The interaction between phonological density and syntactic optimization is not confounded by other typological factors (word
  order, distance-based rankings can be controlled)
- >-
  Spoken language treebanks (e.g., read speech, news corpora) sufficiently capture the phonological pressures that drive spoken
  communication efficiency
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Collect UD treebanks (commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace) and phonological density measures for 40+ languages
  (5+ from each of 8 typologically diverse families). 2. Measure dependency distance distributions (mean, variance, tail behavior)
  using the newly proposed phoneme-position adjacency metric: for each dependency hedge-d-dependent span, compute phoneme-position
  difference rather than word-position difference, weighted by constituent phoneme counts. 3. Control for word-order typology
  (OV/SVO/VSO) and overall distance-based rankings from prior work. 4. Test statistical relationship between phonological
  density metric and DLM strength using hierarchical regression: DLM as response, phonological density as primary predictor,
  language family as random effect, word-order as fixed covariate. 5. Cross-validation within language families to control
  for shared history. 6. Secondary analysis: compare how well this explains variance in DLM across modalities where possible.
success_criteria: >-
  The core hypothesis succeeds if: (1) Linguistic regression shows phonological density is a significant positive predictor
  of DLM strength (more dense = stronger minimization), above and beyond word-order typology; (2) The effect holds across
  5+ independent language families; (3) Family-level patterns emerge consistent with drift rather than sampling noise; (4)
  Sensitivity analyses (controlling for syllable count, stress patterns) confirm the phonological effect is not confounded.

  Krielke (2024) - Diachronic shift toward intra-phrasal dependency relations in scientific English and German, hinting at
  phonological-density interaction
inspiration: >-
  Three cross-field insights combined: (1) MODALITY INTEGRITY (Coupé et al. 2019) - Languages optimize structural properties
  around communicative constraints; (2) MULTIMODAL EFFICIENCY (Rasenberg et al. 2022) - Teams minimize joint effort across
  different behavior types; (3) CROSS-LEVEL CONSTRAINT - Phonological density in chemistry/statistics hoards local configuration
  space, limiting elsewhere. The novel mechanism is borrowing the 'constraint competition' principle from materials physics:
  when one constraint type tightly occupies physical space (phonological adjacency), other systems must adapt (syntactic proximity)
  with different strategies. The phoneme-space dependency metric makes this competition observable.
terms:
- term: Dependency distance minimization (DLM)
  definition: >-
    The tendency of syntactically related words (heads and dependents) to be linearly close to each other in a sentence, reducing
    processing cost.
- term: Mean dependency distance (MDD)
  definition: >-
    The average absolute linear distance between heads and dependents, averaged over all dependency arcs in a corpus—currently
    the dominant aggregate DLM metric.
- term: Phonological density
  definition: >-
    A cross-linguistic measure combining phoneme inventory size, phonotactic complexity (legal consonant clusters), and the
    number of distinct syllable types; higher, or is the most widely reported dependency-distance summary.
- term: Phoneme-position adjacency matrix
  definition: >-
    An extension of token-space distance metrics where dependency distances are computed not in word positions but in underlying
    phoneme character positions, weighted by each word's constituent phoneme count.
- term: Functional vs. lexical dependencies
  definition: >-
    A dichotomy from Gerdes (2026): functional dependencies (determiners, case markers, auxiliaries) are universally short
    because grammar 'hard codes' their adjacency; lexical dependencies (subjects, objects, modifiers) are longer and constrained
    by typology.
summary: >-
  A phonotope density hypothesis predicting that languages with denser phonological inventories exhibit stronger dependency
  distance minimization, tested by measuring dependency distance in phoneme-space U wrongmost from HuggingFace and correlating
  DLM strength with phonological density across 40+ languages.

Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead

EVALUATION executor scope:
  Output: eval_out.json with evaluation results
  DOES: Any evaluation of experiment results — metrics, statistical tests, ablations, comparisons, visualizations, robustness checks, error analysis, etc.
  DOES NOT: Implement new methods (use EXPERIMENT), collect data (use DATASET)
  This is for analyzing experiment outputs from any angle

PROOF executor scope:
  Output: Lean 4 proof files (.lean) with verified theorems
  DOES: Write and verify Lean 4 formal proofs with Mathlib, iterative compilation
  DOES NOT: Run Python experiments, collect data, do empirical analysis
  Use only when formal mathematical guarantees are needed
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
EVALUATION: Must depend on at least one EXPERIMENT. Focus on statistical rigor and validity checks.
PROOF: Use only when the hypothesis requires formal mathematical guarantees. Lean 4 + Mathlib.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<existing_artifacts>
None yet (first iteration).
</existing_artifacts>





<task>
Generate 1 research strategy for THIS iteration.

**ARTIFACT LIMIT: Each strategy may contain AT MOST 3 artifact directions.** Focus on the highest-impact artifacts. Quality over quantity.

Each strategy should:
1. Define a clear OBJECTIVE - what novel contribution we're building toward
2. Plan artifacts to execute NOW - specify type, objective, approach, and depends_on for each
3. Account for parallel execution - all strategies and all planned artifacts run simultaneously, their artifacts are combined into one shared pool

**BROADER IS NOT THE SAME AS DEEPER.** Adding models, datasets, or settings to
an experiment that already ran makes the table bigger; it does not make the
contribution stronger, and it is the default a strategy generator drifts into
when it has nothing sharper to propose. Spend an artifact on scale only when
the SPREAD itself is the finding (a scaling trend, a regime boundary, a
generalisation claim the paper actually makes). Otherwise spend it on
something that could change the conclusion: the mechanism behind an observed
effect, the condition under which it disappears, the confound that would
explain it away, or the baseline whose absence a reviewer would name first.

### [4] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-09-07 21:48:20 UTC

```
Direction: Computational Linguistics — Dependency Distance Minimization Across UD Treebanks. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that measures dependency-distance distributions across UD treebanks, investigates whether spoken language minimizes more than written, characterizes how typology interacts with the pattern, and identifies families that deviate. MUST use commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace.

Ambition: level 3 of 5 — phenomenological science: surface and rigorously characterize a new empirical regularity or anomaly in the data, even before a full theoretical explanation exists.

Reviewer: I am Kaja Dobrovoljc (JSI / University of Ljubljana). Calibrate from my existing papers. Cross-domain methods (information theory, mixed-effects models, sequence models) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for ACL, EMNLP, or the Computational Linguistics journal. Audience: computational linguists and quantitative typologists. Tone: empirically rigorous, careful with linguistic detail, reproducible on public UD.

<hypothesis>
Your strategy should advance this hypothesis.

kind: hypothesis
title: Phonotactic Constraint on Dependency Distance
hypothesis: >-
  Languages with phonologically dense inventories (higher phoneme-to-syllable ratio, more complex phonotactics) exhibit stronger
  dependency distance minimization than languages with sparse inventories. The phonological constraint of tight adjacency
  in dense systems effectively 'hoards' close proximity slots that would otherwise be free for syntactic dependency optimization.
motivation: >-
  Current dependency distance research suffers from two blindspots: (1) all work uses WORD-SPACE distance, missing phonological
  proximity constraints; (2) no one has tested whether phonological density modulates the strength of syntactic minimization.
  The findings on comparable information rates across speech and writing suggest speakers optimize around channel capacity.
  By shifting the unit of analysis from words to phonemes, this hypothesis joins the phonotactic/phonemic layer with the syntactic
  layer to reveal a cross-layer cost constraint that explains otherwise puzzling cross-linguistic patterns in DLM strength.
assumptions:
- >-
  UD treebanks are comparable across languages for extracting dependency distance patterns
- >-
  Phoneme inventory sizes and syllabification patterns are reliably available in cross-linguistic resources (e.g., Glottolog,
  Lexibank)
- >-
  The interaction between phonological density and syntactic optimization is not confounded by other typological factors (word
  order, distance-based rankings can be controlled)
- >-
  Spoken language treebanks (e.g., read speech, news corpora) sufficiently capture the phonological pressures that drive spoken
  communication efficiency
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Collect UD treebanks (commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace) and phonological density measures for 40+ languages
  (5+ from each of 8 typologically diverse families). 2. Measure dependency distance distributions (mean, variance, tail behavior)
  using the newly proposed phoneme-position adjacency metric: for each dependency hedge-d-dependent span, compute phoneme-position
  difference rather than word-position difference, weighted by constituent phoneme counts. 3. Control for word-order typology
  (OV/SVO/VSO) and overall distance-based rankings from prior work. 4. Test statistical relationship between phonological
  density metric and DLM strength using hierarchical regression: DLM as response, phonological density as primary predictor,
  language family as random effect, word-order as fixed covariate. 5. Cross-validation within language families to control
  for shared history. 6. Secondary analysis: compare how well this explains variance in DLM across modalities where possible.
success_criteria: >-
  The core hypothesis succeeds if: (1) Linguistic regression shows phonological density is a significant positive predictor
  of DLM strength (more dense = stronger minimization), above and beyond word-order typology; (2) The effect holds across
  5+ independent language families; (3) Family-level patterns emerge consistent with drift rather than sampling noise; (4)
  Sensitivity analyses (controlling for syllable count, stress patterns) confirm the phonological effect is not confounded.

inspiration: >-
  Three cross-field insights combined: (1) MODALITY INTEGRITY (Coupé et al. 2019) - Languages optimize structural properties
  around communicative constraints; (2) MULTIMODAL EFFICIENCY (Rasenberg et al. 2022) - Teams minimize joint effort across
  different behavior types; (3) CROSS-LEVEL CONSTRAINT - Phonological density in chemistry/statistics hoards local configuration
  space, limiting elsewhere. The novel mechanism is borrowing the 'constraint competition' principle from materials physics:
  when one constraint type tightly occupies physical space (phonological adjacency), other systems must adapt (syntactic proximity)
  with different strategies. The phoneme-space dependency metric makes this competition observable.
terms:
- term: Dependency distance minimization (DLM)
  definition: >-
    The tendency of syntactically related words (heads and dependents) to be linearly close to each other in a sentence, reducing
    processing cost.
- term: Mean dependency distance (MDD)
  definition: >-
    The average absolute linear distance between heads and dependents, averaged over all dependency arcs in a corpus—currently
    the dominant aggregate DLM metric.
- term: Phonological density
  definition: >-
    A cross-linguistic measure combining phoneme inventory size, phonotactic complexity (legal consonant clusters), and the
    number of distinct syllable types; higher, or is the most widely reported dependency-distance summary.
- term: Phoneme-position adjacency matrix
  definition: >-
    An extension of token-space distance metrics where dependency distances are computed not in word positions but in underlying
    phoneme character positions, weighted by each word's constituent phoneme count.
- term: Functional vs. lexical dependencies
  definition: >-
    A dichotomy from Gerdes (2026): functional dependencies (determiners, case markers, auxiliaries) are universally short
    because grammar 'hard codes' their adjacency; lexical dependencies (subjects, objects, modifiers) are longer and constrained
    by typology.
summary: >-
  A phonotope density hypothesis predicting that languages with denser phonological inventories exhibit stronger dependency
  distance minimization, tested by measuring dependency distance in phoneme-space U wrongmost from HuggingFace and correlating
  DLM strength with phonological density across 40+ languages.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead

EVALUATION executor scope:
  Output: eval_out.json with evaluation results
  DOES: Any evaluation of experiment results — metrics, statistical tests, ablations, comparisons, visualizations, robustness checks, error analysis, etc.
  DOES NOT: Implement new methods (use EXPERIMENT), collect data (use DATASET)
  This is for analyzing experiment outputs from any angle

PROOF executor scope:
  Output: Lean 4 proof files (.lean) with verified theorems
  DOES: Write and verify Lean 4 formal proofs with Mathlib, iterative compilation
  DOES NOT: Run Python experiments, collect data, do empirical analysis
  Use only when formal mathematical guarantees are needed
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
EVALUATION: Must depend on at least one EXPERIMENT. Focus on statistical rigor and validity checks.
PROOF: Use only when the hypothesis requires formal mathematical guarantees. Lean 4 + Mathlib.

None yet (first iteration).
</existing_artifacts>





<task>
Generate 1 research strategy for THIS iteration.

**ARTIFACT LIMIT: Each strategy may contain AT MOST 3 artifact directions.** Focus on the highest-impact artifacts. Quality over quantity.

Each strategy should:
1. Define a clear OBJECTIVE - what novel contribution we're building toward
2. Plan artifacts to execute NOW - specify type, objective, approach, and depends_on for each
3. Account for parallel execution - all strategies and all planned artifacts run simultaneously, their artifacts are combined into one shared pool

**BROADER IS NOT THE SAME AS DEEPER.** Adding models, datasets, or settings to
an experiment that already ran makes the table bigger; it does not make the
contribution stronger, and it is the default a strategy generator drifts into
when it has nothing sharper to propose. Spend an artifact on scale only when
the SPREAD itself is the finding (a scaling trend, a regime boundary, a
generalisation claim the paper actually makes). Otherwise spend it on
something that could change the conclusion: the mechanism behind an observed
effect, the condition under which it disappears, the confound that would
explain it away, or the baseline whose absence a reviewer would name first.

### [6] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-09-07 21:50:19 UTC

```
Direction: Computational Linguistics — Dependency Distance Minimization Across UD Treebanks. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that measures dependency-distance distributions across UD treebanks, investigates whether spoken language minimizes more than written, characterizes how typology interacts with the pattern, and identifies families that deviate. MUST use commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace.

Ambition: level 3 of 5 — phenomenological science: surface and rigorously characterize a new empirical regularity or anomaly in the data, even before a full theoretical explanation exists.

Reviewer: I am Kaja Dobrovoljc (JSI / University of Ljubljana). Calibrate from my existing papers. Cross-domain methods (information theory, mixed-effects models, sequence models) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for ACL, EMNLP, or the Computational Linguistics journal. Audience: computational linguists and quantitative typologists. Tone: empirically rigorous, careful with linguistic detail, reproducible on public UD.
```
