<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Phonotactic Constraint on Dependency Distance
hypothesis: >-
  Languages with phonologically dense inventories (higher phoneme-to-syllable ratio, more complex phonotactics) exhibit stronger
  dependency distance minimization than languages with sparse inventories. The phonological constraint of tight adjacency
  in dense systems effectively 'hoards' close proximity slots that would otherwise be free for syntactic dependency optimization.
motivation: >-
  Current dependency distance research suffers from two blindspots: (1) all work uses WORD-SPACE distance, missing phonological
  proximity constraints; (2) no one has tested whether phonological density modulates the strength of syntactic minimization.
  The findings on comparable information rates across speech and writing suggest speakers optimize around channel capacity.
  By shifting the unit of analysis from words to phonemes, this hypothesis joins the phonotactic/phonemic layer with the syntactic
  layer to reveal a cross-layer cost constraint that explains otherwise puzzling cross-linguistic patterns in DLM strength.
assumptions:
- >-
  UD treebanks are comparable across languages for extracting dependency distance patterns
- >-
  Phoneme inventory sizes and syllabification patterns are reliably available in cross-linguistic resources (e.g., Glottolog,
  Lexibank)
- >-
  The interaction between phonological density and syntactic optimization is not confounded by other typological factors (word
  order, distance-based rankings can be controlled)
- >-
  Spoken language treebanks (e.g., read speech, news corpora) sufficiently capture the phonological pressures that drive spoken
  communication efficiency
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Collect UD treebanks (commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace) and phonological density measures for 40+ languages
  (5+ from each of 8 typologically diverse families). 2. Measure dependency distance distributions (mean, variance, tail behavior)
  using the newly proposed phoneme-position adjacency metric: for each dependency hedge-d-dependent span, compute phoneme-position
  difference rather than word-position difference, weighted by constituent phoneme counts. 3. Control for word-order typology
  (OV/SVO/VSO) and overall distance-based rankings from prior work. 4. Test statistical relationship between phonological
  density metric and DLM strength using hierarchical regression: DLM as response, phonological density as primary predictor,
  language family as random effect, word-order as fixed covariate. 5. Cross-validation within language families to control
  for shared history. 6. Secondary analysis: compare how well this explains variance in DLM across modalities where possible.
success_criteria: >-
  The core hypothesis succeeds if: (1) Linguistic regression shows phonological density is a significant positive predictor
  of DLM strength (more dense = stronger minimization), above and beyond word-order typology; (2) The effect holds across
  5+ independent language families; (3) Family-level patterns emerge consistent with drift rather than sampling noise; (4)
  Sensitivity analyses (controlling for syllable count, stress patterns) confirm the phonological effect is not confounded.

  unstable across treebanks, MDD is corpus-conditioned composite

  word-length minimization
- >-
  Krielke (2024) - Diachronic shift toward intra-phrasal dependency relations in scientific English and German, hinting at
  phonological-density interaction
inspiration: >-
  Three cross-field insights combined: (1) MODALITY INTEGRITY (Coupé et al. 2019) - Languages optimize structural properties
  around communicative constraints; (2) MULTIMODAL EFFICIENCY (Rasenberg et al. 2022) - Teams minimize joint effort across
  different behavior types; (3) CROSS-LEVEL CONSTRAINT - Phonological density in chemistry/statistics hoards local configuration
  space, limiting elsewhere. The novel mechanism is borrowing the 'constraint competition' principle from materials physics:
  when one constraint type tightly occupies physical space (phonological adjacency), other systems must adapt (syntactic proximity)
  with different strategies. The phoneme-space dependency metric makes this competition observable.
terms:
- term: Dependency distance minimization (DLM)
  definition: >-
    The tendency of syntactically related words (heads and dependents) to be linearly close to each other in a sentence, reducing
    processing cost.
- term: Mean dependency distance (MDD)
  definition: >-
    The average absolute linear distance between heads and dependents, averaged over all dependency arcs in a corpus—currently
    the dominant aggregate DLM metric.
- term: Phonological density
  definition: >-
    A cross-linguistic measure combining phoneme inventory size, phonotactic complexity (legal consonant clusters), and the
    number of distinct syllable types; higher, or is the most widely reported dependency-distance summary.
- term: Phoneme-position adjacency matrix
  definition: >-
    An extension of token-space distance metrics where dependency distances are computed not in word positions but in underlying
    phoneme character positions, weighted by each word's constituent phoneme count.
- term: Functional vs. lexical dependencies
  definition: >-
    A dichotomy from Gerdes (2026): functional dependencies (determiners, case markers, auxiliaries) are universally short
    because grammar 'hard codes' their adjacency; lexical dependencies (subjects, objects, modifiers) are longer and constrained
    by typology.
summary: >-
  A phonotope density hypothesis predicting that languages with denser phonological inventories exhibit stronger dependency
  distance minimization, tested by measuring dependency distance in phoneme-space U wrongmost from HuggingFace and correlating
  DLM strength with phonological density across 40+ languages.

Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for judging whether the hypothesis is genuinely novel versus already-done or a known dead end in this field.

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

### [2] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-09-07 21:43:42 UTC

```
Direction: Computational Linguistics — Dependency Distance Minimization Across UD Treebanks. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that measures dependency-distance distributions across UD treebanks, investigates whether spoken language minimizes more than written, characterizes how typology interacts with the pattern, and identifies families that deviate. MUST use commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace.

Ambition: level 3 of 5 — phenomenological science: surface and rigorously characterize a new empirical regularity or anomaly in the data, even before a full theoretical explanation exists.

Reviewer: I am Kaja Dobrovoljc (JSI / University of Ljubljana). Calibrate from my existing papers. Cross-domain methods (information theory, mixed-effects models, sequence models) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for ACL, EMNLP, or the Computational Linguistics journal. Audience: computational linguists and quantitative typologists. Tone: empirically rigorous, careful with linguistic detail, reproducible on public UD.
```

name: aii-web-tools
description: "Runs web search, page fetch as markdown, and regex grep over full HTML or PDF text via this skill's own scripts (aii_fast_web_search.py, aii_fast_web_fetch.py) — a free-first keyless search stack with Serper fallback that works even where built-in WebSearch and WebFetch are absent. Use when a query, page, or paper must be searched, read, or mined for an exact quote, number, table value, or methodology sentence, and whenever a lossy summary would lose the detail. Triggers: web search, scholarly search, OpenAlex, Crossref, Serper, fetch a URL as markdown, read a PDF, arXiv, regex grep a page, exact quote, table value, citation check. NOT for: planning a broad multi-source literature review or mass verification campaign — use aii-web-research-tools; NOT for a PDF file already on disk — extraction, form filling, merging and PDF creation are anthropic-pdf; NOT for driving a browser or testing a UI."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.
