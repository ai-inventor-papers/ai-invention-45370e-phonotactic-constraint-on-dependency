<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: RESEARCH

RESEARCH
Web research to answer key questions — like a researcher making decisions.
Runtime: LLM Agent, no code execution.
Tools: the aii-web-tools skill (web search, page fetch, regex grep over full page/PDF text).
Capabilities: Find, synthesize, and compare information across sources; survey SOTA and best practices.
Deps: REQUIRED none | OPTIONAL other RESEARCH to build on prior findings
</artifact_type_info>

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.
</software_constraints>
</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The research executor has 3h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Phonological Density Does Not Predict DLM Strength
hypothesis: >-
  Languages with higher phonological density do not exhibit systematically stronger dependency distance minimization (DLM).
  Cross-linguistic tests across 55 languages from 10 families show no significant relationship between phoneme inventory size
  and mean dependency distance (Spearman r = 0.19, p = 0.17; R² = 0.05), with the weak correlation running opposite to the
  predicted direction. Phonological density and syntactic optimization appear to operate as largely independent constraints
  on linear order. Any residual phonological effect on DLM is likely mediated not by direct compression of syntactic dependencies
  but by alternative compensatory mechanisms: (1) phonological reduction of words adjacent to long-distance dependencies,
  (2) increased morphological marking to clarify grammatical roles without linear proximity, or (3) modulation at the phonological
  phrasing/prosodic interface rather than the syntactic level. The null finding itself constitutes a contribution: it establishes
  that the phonotactic constraint hypothesis — the idea that phonological crowding 'hoards' adjacency slots for syntactic
  optimization — does not hold at the cross-linguistic level. Future tests should (a) control for phylogenetic non-independence
  using mixed-effects models with language family as random intercept, (b) distinguish between phoneme-space span (phonemes
  in intervening words) and phoneme-weighted distance (distance weighted by connected word phoneme counts), and (c) test for
  modality-specific effects using spoken corpora where available.
motivation: >-
  Current dependency distance research suffers from two blindspots: (1) all work uses WORD-SPACE distance, missing phonological
  proximity constraints; (2) no one has tested whether phonological density modulates the strength of syntactic minimization.
  The findings on comparable information rates across speech and writing suggest speakers optimize around channel capacity.
  By shifting the unit of analysis from words to phonemes, this hypothesis joins the phonotactic/phonemic layer with the syntactic
  layer to reveal a cross-layer cost constraint that explains otherwise puzzling cross-linguistic patterns in DLM strength.
assumptions:
- >-
  UD treebanks are comparable across languages for extracting dependency distance patterns
- >-
  Phoneme inventory sizes and syllabification patterns are reliably available in cross-linguistic resources (e.g., Glottolog,
  Lexibank)
- >-
  The interaction between phonological density and syntactic optimization is not confounded by other typological factors (word
  order, distance-based rankings can be controlled)
- >-
  Spoken language treebanks (e.g., read speech, news corpora) sufficiently capture the phonological pressures that drive spoken
  communication efficiency
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Collect UD treebanks (commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace) and phonological density measures for 40+ languages
  (5+ from each of 8 typologically diverse families). 2. Measure dependency distance distributions (mean, variance, tail behavior)
  using the newly proposed phoneme-position adjacency metric: for each dependency hedge-d-dependent span, compute phoneme-position
  difference rather than word-position difference, weighted by constituent phoneme counts. 3. Control for word-order typology
  (OV/SVO/VSO) and overall distance-based rankings from prior work. 4. Test statistical relationship between phonological
  density metric and DLM strength using hierarchical regression: DLM as response, phonological density as primary predictor,
  language family as random effect, word-order as fixed covariate. 5. Cross-validation within language families to control
  for shared history. 6. Secondary analysis: compare how well this explains variance in DLM across modalities where possible.
success_criteria: >-
  The core hypothesis succeeds if: (1) Linguistic regression shows phonological density is a significant positive predictor
  of DLM strength (more dense = stronger minimization), above and beyond word-order typology; (2) The effect holds across
  5+ independent language families; (3) Family-level patterns emerge consistent with drift rather than sampling noise; (4)
  Sensitivity analyses (controlling for syllable count, stress patterns) confirm the phonological effect is not confounded.

- >-
  Krielke (2024) - Diachronic shift toward intra-phrasal dependency relations in scientific English and German, hinting at
  phonological-density interaction
inspiration: >-
  Three cross-field insights combined: (1) MODALITY INTEGRITY (Coupé et al. 2019) - Languages optimize structural properties
  around communicative constraints; (2) MULTIMODAL EFFICIENCY (Rasenberg et al. 2022) - Teams minimize joint effort across
  different behavior types; (3) CROSS-LEVEL CONSTRAINT - Phonological density in chemistry/statistics hoards local configuration
  space, limiting elsewhere. The novel mechanism is borrowing the 'constraint competition' principle from materials physics:
  when one constraint type tightly occupies physical space (phonological adjacency), other systems must adapt (syntactic proximity)
  with different strategies. The phoneme-space dependency metric makes this competition observable.
terms:
- term: Dependency distance minimization (DLM)
  definition: >-
    The tendency of syntactically related words (heads and dependents) to be linearly close to each other in a sentence, reducing
    processing cost.
- term: Mean dependency distance (MDD)
  definition: >-
    The average absolute linear distance between heads and dependents, averaged over all dependency arcs in a corpus—currently
    the dominant aggregate DLM metric.
- term: Phonological density
  definition: >-
    A cross-linguistic measure combining phoneme inventory size, phonotactic complexity (legal consonant clusters), and the
    number of distinct syllable types; higher, or is the most widely reported dependency-distance summary.
- term: Phoneme-position adjacency matrix
  definition: >-
    An extension of token-space distance metrics where dependency distances are computed not in word positions but in underlying
    phoneme character positions, weighted by each word's constituent phoneme count.
- term: Functional vs. lexical dependencies
  definition: >-
    A dichotomy from Gerdes (2026): functional dependencies (determiners, case markers, auxiliaries) are universally short
    because grammar 'hard codes' their adjacency; lexical dependencies (subjects, objects, modifiers) are longer and constrained
    by typology.
summary: >-
  A phonotope density hypothesis predicting that languages with denser phonological inventories exhibit stronger dependency
  distance minimization, tested by measuring dependency distance in phoneme-space U wrongmost from HuggingFace and correlating
  DLM strength with phonological density across 40+ languages.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Same conceptual frame refined: evidence rejects original positive prediction in favor of null hypothesis
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Reversed primary prediction: phonological density does NOT predict stronger DLM; weak positive correlation found instead
  (r=0.19, p=0.17)
- >-
  Null finding reframed as contribution: establishes phonological density and syntactic optimization as independent constraints
- >-
  Added phylogenetic control requirement: mixed-effects models with family random intercept needed to address 28/55 Indo-European
  sample skew
- >-
  Proposed alternative mechanisms: phonological reduction of adjacent words, increased morphological marking, prosodic-phrase-level
  mediation
- >-
  Specified PPAD metric correction: should sum phonemes of intervening words, not weight by connected-word average phoneme
  count
- >-
  Added sensitivity analysis requirement: test with complete phonological data subsample and distinguish real vs. approximated
  phoneme counts
- >-
  Added requirement to engage with Ferrer-i-Cancho & Gomez-Rodriguez (2021) who tested reverse direction (DLM -> phonological
  compression) using UD treebanks
- >-
  Narrowed scope to cross-linguistic level only; acknowledged that effects may operate at different timescales (diachronic
  phonology vs. synchronic syntax)

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

### [4] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-09-08 00:06:40 UTC

```
Direction: Computational Linguistics — Dependency Distance Minimization Across UD Treebanks. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that measures dependency-distance distributions across UD treebanks, investigates whether spoken language minimizes more than written, characterizes how typology interacts with the pattern, and identifies families that deviate. MUST use commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace.

Ambition: level 3 of 5 — phenomenological science: surface and rigorously characterize a new empirical regularity or anomaly in the data, even before a full theoretical explanation exists.

Reviewer: I am Kaja Dobrovoljc (JSI / University of Ljubljana). Calibrate from my existing papers. Cross-domain methods (information theory, mixed-effects models, sequence models) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for ACL, EMNLP, or the Computational Linguistics journal. Audience: computational linguists and quantitative typologists. Tone: empirically rigorous, careful with linguistic detail, reproducible on public UD.
```

### [5] THINKING · 2026-09-08 00:06:42 UTC

```
Let me analyze this carefully. I need to create a detailed research plan for an executor agent. The plan is for a RESEARCH artifact that needs to conduct deep literature engagement with Ferrer-i-Cancho & Gómez-Rodríguez (2021) and related work.

Let me first understand the context:
1. The hypothesis is about phonological density not predicting DLM strength
2. The research direction asks to engage with Ferrer-i-Cancho & Gómez-Rodríguez (2021) paper
3. The user's original request is about dependency distance minimization across UD treebanks
4. I need to plan web research that the executor will carry out

Let me search for the key paper and related work to make the plan concrete and actionable.

Peer-reviewed baseline beneath it: reliability varies by\n  property, judge expertise, and whether text is human- or model-generated [S21] (ACL 2025).\n- Contamination has its own position paper, which sets out to \"highlight the wide prevalence of\n  benchmark dataset contamination and outline the properties of contamination-resistant datasets\"\n  [S14] (ICML 2026 Position Track).\n\n**What LMs represent vs what they output**\n\n- A grammaticality probe \"outperforms LM probability-based grammaticality judgments\" \u2014 yet\n  on semantic plausibility \"the probe however performs worse than string probability\" [S12] (2026-05).\n- ACL 2026's Best Paper found a directional semantic failure: a \"pervasive Teleological Bias\" where\n  models \"hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events, even overriding explicit textual\n  cancellation\"; prompting interventions \"partially reduce this bias but trigger a calibration\n  crisis\" [S8] (2026).\n\n**Cognitive modelling and the scale paradox**\n\n- Surprisal's fit to reading times peaks near two billion training tokens, after which perplexity\n  gains produce \"poorer fits to human reading times\" [S16] (Findings of EMNLP 2023).\n- Not an artifact of latency measures \u2014 the inverse relation \"still obtains\" on two fMRI datasets\n  across 17 LMs [S17] (EACL 2026).\n- The predictor is unstable: early-layer representations beat surprisal on early-pass eye movements,\n  and \"the best-performing predictor varies strongly depending on the language and eye-tracking\n  measure\" [S23] (ACL 2026).\n\n**The resource map and language varieties**\n\n- Catalogue counts mislead: 59% of the surveyed languages score zero catalogued-dataset density, yet literature mining shows active dataset production for many [S5] (2026-05).\n- The dominant multilingual benchmark is criticized at protocol level \u2014 many translations \"fall below\n  the claimed 90% quality standard\", and \"copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU\n  scores\" [S13] (EMNLP 2025).\n\n**Annotation, disagreement, pluralism**\n\n- The perspectivist turn has its own survey, mapping \"a shift from consensus learning toward\n  explicitly modeling disagreement, and toward capturing structured relationships among\n  annotators\" [S6] (2026-01).\n\n**Meta-science of the field**\n\n- Submission volume outran reviewing capacity \u2014 17,087 submissions against 1,424 area chairs,\n  with the community weighing \"options for limiting submissions for the first time in ACL's\n  history\" [S1] (2026-05) \u2014 yet measured review quality shows \"no consistent decline in median\n  review quality across venues and years\" [S22] (2026-01). ACL 2026's special theme was model\n  explainability [S10].\n\n## Recent (~1\u20132 yr, compressed) \u00b7 Durable core\n\n- Durable and still load-bearing: surprisal theory as the LM-to-processing-cost bridge [S16];\n  minimal-pair evaluation as the standard syntactic instrument [S12]; direct probability\n  measurement as the stronger read-out of linguistic knowledge [S3]; the child-learning data\n  bound \u2014 \"less than 100 million words\" \u2014 with curriculum learning, heavily attempted,\n  \"largely unsuccessful\" [S18].\n- The three standing stances on LLMs and linguistic theory [S4]: **insulationism** (LLMs are\n  irrelevant to human language), **eliminativism** (they can replace traditional linguistic\n  theories), **conciliationism** (they are useful tools for linguistic research).\n\n## \u26d4 Already crowded \u2014 go ELSEWHERE (do-not-redo)\n\nThe blank space is NOT in these lanes; each is saturated through H1-2026:\n\n- **Creating another multilingual / low-resource benchmark.** Dense and institutionalized: the\n  FLORES+ family plus its published protocol critique [S13], variety-level suites [S19], and\n  and a 232-paper survey of the multilingual/edge pipeline [S20].\n- **Benchmark-contamination detection.** Saturated; the prevalence of contamination and the\n  properties of resistant datasets are already laid out in a peer-reviewed position paper [S14].\n- **LLM-as-judge meta-evaluation and bias catalogues.** A 20-dataset / 11-model peer-reviewed study\n  [S21] plus a dedicated 2026 workshop [S25] own this.\n- **Minimal-pair grammaticality evaluation and its representation-level follow-up.** Models already\n  \"discriminate well between grammatical and ungrammatical sentences in tightly controlled minimal\n  pairs\", and the probe-vs-probability comparison is published [S12].\n- **Human label variation / perspectivist modelling.** Mapped end-to-end by its own survey [S6] and\n  already escalated into post-training [S7].\n- **Computational morphology and low-resource dependency parsing.** Both have their own survey and\n  a 2026 cross-architecture evaluation [S29] [S30].\n- **Computational sociolinguistics / dialect NLP.** Mapped by its own survey [S27], with a\n  variety-level benchmark already published [S19].\n- **Sign-language processing tooling and reproducibility.** The ad-hoc-code problem and a framework\n  answer to it are published [S28].\n- **Language-documentation annotation tooling.** 98 tools already surveyed against documentary\n  requirements [S26].\n- **Coreference and discourse resolution.** A shared-task series in its fifth edition, with a 2026\n  benchmark wave alongside it [S31].\n- **Diachronic / lexical semantic change.** Mature enough that its canonical benchmark is itself\n  under published critique, with a dedicated workshop series [S32].\n- **Surprisal-vs-reading-time psychometrics.** The inverse-scaling result, its tipping point, its\n  fMRI generalization, and its layerwise refinement are all published [S16] [S17] [S23].\n\n> **Standing directive \u2014 this list is necessarily INCOMPLETE.** Map-silence means *not-yet-checked*,\n> NOT *open*. Before committing to any direction this map does not explicitly flag as crowded, run a\n> fresh, dated saturation search and confirm the space is actually unoccupied. (Measured in this forge's own\n> A/B runs: a live-searching baseline beats a static handbook precisely on the crowded lanes a map omits.)\n\n## Open questions the field hasn't answered\n\n*(the whole lens \u2014 the reader answers in their own way)*\n\n1. Prompted output underestimates linguistic knowledge [S3], and grammaticality separates in hidden\n   states where string probability does not [S12]. **Is the observable this field treats as its\n   measurement \u2014 model output, or string probability \u2014 even the right object for a claim about\n   linguistic competence?** Instruments changed without this being settled.\n2. If a review of 445 benchmarks finds validity-undermining patterns [S2] while judge validity is a\n   property of a whole pipeline rather than a judge [S25], what would a capability claim here have\n   to report before it should be believed?\n3. LLMs supply how-possibly but not how-actually explanations of language [S4]. What evidence would\n   move a computational result across that line, and does any current design even address it?\n4. The best cognitive predictor is a deliberately undertrained model [S16] [S17], while the strongest\n   predictor varies by layer, language, and measure [S23]. What is being modelled when psychometric\n   fit and language-modelling quality pull in opposite directions?\n5. Catalogue counts and literature evidence disagree about which languages are resourced [S5], and\n   the dominant benchmark is protocol-flawed for exactly those languages [S13]. Is \"low-resource\" a\n   property of languages, of documentation infrastructure, or of evaluation design?\n6. Submission volume outran reviewing capacity to the point of considering caps [S1], yet measured\n   review quality has not declined [S22]. If the bottleneck is not quality, what is the constraint\n   actually selecting for in what gets published?\n\n## What counts as DEEP here (taste)\n\n| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Add a benchmark, a language, or a model to an existing evaluation and report the numbers. | *Computational Linguistics* prints the bar for a **squib**: \"unexpectedness, as for example a demonstration that a commonly accepted idea or method is flawed\", or \"genuine novelty, as for example thus-far unnoticed language data that challenges current methods\". Not \"more coverage\". | problematizes-nothing \u2014 coverage counts only if it breaks something | A | [S9] |\n| Probe an LLM on a linguistic phenomenon and report accuracy. | The ACL 2026 **Best Paper** derived a diagnostic from linguistic theory, found a *systematic directional* failure \u2014 models \"systematically hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events\" \u2014 and showed prompting fixes \"partially reduce this bias but trigger a calibration crisis\". Theory-derived contrast plus a failure with a shape. | problematizes-nothing \u2014 an accuracy number on a new phenomenon is coverage | L | [S8] |\n| Conclude from failed metalinguistic prompts that a model lacks a linguistic generalization. | **Buried (EMNLP 2023):** metalinguistic judgments are inferior to direct probability read-outs, and \"consistency gets worse as the prompt query diverges from direct measurements of next-word probabilities\". Reopening condition: the same negative result reproduced against direct probability measurement. | wrong-result \u2014 you measured the probe, not the model | L | [S3] |\n\n> **Science-vs-application, as this field draws it:** the journal asks for a \"substantive\n> contribution to the computational processing of language\" and clear unexpectedness, genuine\n> novelty, or broad relevance [S9]. A working system with a headline number and no overturned\n> assumption is application-tier \u2014 hence the separate resource, demo, and social-impact award\n> tracks rather than one axis [S15].\n\n## Critical rules (execution \u00b7 eval \u00b7 validity)\n\n| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Test linguistic knowledge by prompting the model to judge. | Designing the probe: read probabilities directly where possible; report prompting as a second, weaker measurement \u2014 never as sole evidence for absence. | wrong-result \u2014 negative results are unsound from prompts alone | L | [S3] |\n| Report benchmark accuracy as a capability claim. | Writing the claim: define the construct, say how items operationalize it, and report uncertainty. | wrong-result \u2014 the score does not measure the named phenomenon | L | [S2] |\n| Use FLORES+ as ground truth for low-resource MT quality. | Choosing the eval set: check quality and domain fit for your languages and add a naturalistic set \u2014 models strong on one can look weak on the other. | wrong-result \u2014 the benchmark's own quality bound caps your conclusion | L | [S13] |\n| Aggregate annotations to a majority label by default. | Handling annotation: decide explicitly whether disagreement is error or signal for THIS task; preserve the distribution when it is signal. | wrong-result \u2014 artificial consensus erases the phenomenon | L | [S7] [S6] |\n| Reach for a pretrained transformer parser on a low-resource language. | Choosing the architecture: below the data crossover a Biaffine LSTM beats transformers, and morphological complexity widens that disadvantage. | wasted-cost \u2014 the bigger model is the weaker one in that regime | L | [S30] |\n| Call a language low-resource from catalogue counts. | Scoping resources: check literature-level dataset circulation, not just registered catalogues, before claiming a data gap. | wrong-result \u2014 the gap may be documentation, not data | L | [S5] |\n| Argue cognitive plausibility from a bigger, better LM. | Making a processing claim: treat training data and model scale as deliberate variables and report layer and measure \u2014 the best predictor changes with both. | wrong-result \u2014 the inverse relation holds on latency and fMRI alike [S17]; fit peaks near 2B training tokens [S16] | L | [S16] [S17] [S23] |\n\n## Decision guide\n\n- **Competence vs performance:** for \"does the model know X\", read probabilities or probe\n  representations [S3] [S12]; for \"does it use X when generating\", behavioral output is right \u2014\n  do not swap them.\n- **Cognitive-modelling target:** latency and fMRI now agree on inverse scaling [S16] [S17]; early-\n  vs late-pass measures disagree on the best predictor [S23] \u2014 name the measure before the model.\n- **Aggregating annotations:** aggregate when the task has a defensible single answer; preserve the\n  distribution when variation is interpretive [S6] [S7].\n- **Placing yourself in the theory debate:** the field names three positions \u2014 insulationist,\n  eliminativist, conciliationist [S4]; a paper implies one whether or not it says so.\n\n## Ground rules (known-lane \u2014 terse)\n\n- Surprisal = negative log probability of a word in context; the standard LM-to-processing-cost link [S16].\n- Minimal pairs = near-identical sentences differing in acceptability; BLiMP-style suites are the\n  canonical syntactic instrument [S12].\n- Human label variation (HLV) = legitimate annotator disagreement, distinct from annotation error [S7].\n- Construct validity = whether a measure represents the phenomenon it names; now a routine reviewer\n  question in this field [S2].\n\n## Reference documentation\n\n- **[volatile.md](volatile.md)** \u2014 dated frontier numbers, lane-occupancy flags, and per-source\n  review status. Re-check this FIRST before any novelty verdict or write-up.\n\n## Candidate lane  \u26a0\ufe0f (expert to resolve \u2014 NOT verified)\n\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **No peer-reviewed 2026 synthesis of \"what computational linguistics is now\" was recoverable\n  this pass.** A Philosophy Compass survey of the philosophy of language models exists but was\n  paywalled; the field-identity framing rests on one preprint [S4] plus venue artifacts [S9] [S10].\n  Confirm before asserting a field-wide consensus in a write-up.\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **The ACL 2026 award slate could not be read with committee rationale** \u2014 the page lists titles\n  only, so the taste row rests on the paper's own abstract [S8] plus the journal's printed criteria\n  [S9], not a meta-review.

```
<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: RESEARCH

RESEARCH
Web research to answer key questions — like a researcher making decisions.
Runtime: LLM Agent, no code execution.
Tools: the aii-web-tools skill (web search, page fetch, regex grep over full page/PDF text).
Capabilities: Find, synthesize, and compare information across sources; survey SOTA and best practices.
Deps: REQUIRED none | OPTIONAL other RESEARCH to build on prior findings
</artifact_type_info>

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.
</software_constraints>
</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The research executor has 3h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Phonological Density Does Not Predict DLM Strength
hypothesis: >-
  Languages with higher phonological density do not exhibit systematically stronger dependency distance minimization (DLM).
  Cross-linguistic tests across 55 languages from 10 families show no significant relationship between phoneme inventory size
  and mean dependency distance (Spearman r = 0.19, p = 0.17; R² = 0.05), with the weak correlation running opposite to the
  predicted direction. Phonological density and syntactic optimization appear to operate as largely independent constraints
  on linear order. Any residual phonological effect on DLM is likely mediated not by direct compression of syntactic dependencies
  but by alternative compensatory mechanisms: (1) phonological reduction of words adjacent to long-distance dependencies,
  (2) increased morphological marking to clarify grammatical roles without linear proximity, or (3) modulation at the phonological
  phrasing/prosodic interface rather than the syntactic level. The null finding itself constitutes a contribution: it establishes
  that the phonotactic constraint hypothesis — the idea that phonological crowding 'hoards' adjacency slots for syntactic
  optimization — does not hold at the cross-linguistic level. Future tests should (a) control for phylogenetic non-independence
  using mixed-effects models with language family as random intercept, (b) distinguish between phoneme-space span (phonemes
  in intervening words) and phoneme-weighted distance (distance weighted by connected word phoneme counts), and (c) test for
  modality-specific effects using spoken corpora where available.
motivation: >-
  Current dependency distance research suffers from two blindspots: (1) all work uses WORD-SPACE distance, missing phonological
  proximity constraints; (2) no one has tested whether phonological density modulates the strength of syntactic minimization.
  The findings on comparable information rates across speech and writing suggest speakers optimize around channel capacity.
  By shifting the unit of analysis from words to phonemes, this hypothesis joins the phonotactic/phonemic layer with the syntactic
  layer to reveal a cross-layer cost constraint that explains otherwise puzzling cross-linguistic patterns in DLM strength.
assumptions:
- >-
  UD treebanks are comparable across languages for extracting dependency distance patterns
- >-
  Phoneme inventory sizes and syllabification patterns are reliably available in cross-linguistic resources (e.g., Glottolog,
  Lexibank)
- >-
  The interaction between phonological density and syntactic optimization is not confounded by other typological factors (word
  order, distance-based rankings can be controlled)
- >-
  Spoken language treebanks (e.g., read speech, news corpora) sufficiently capture the phonological pressures that drive spoken
  communication efficiency
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Collect UD treebanks (commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace) and phonological density measures for 40+ languages
  (5+ from each of 8 typologically diverse families). 2. Measure dependency distance distributions (mean, variance, tail behavior)
  using the newly proposed phoneme-position adjacency metric: for each dependency hedge-d-dependent span, compute phoneme-position
  difference rather than word-position difference, weighted by constituent phoneme counts. 3. Control for word-order typology
  (OV/SVO/VSO) and overall distance-based rankings from prior work. 4. Test statistical relationship between phonological
  density metric and DLM strength using hierarchical regression: DLM as response, phonological density as primary predictor,
  language family as random effect, word-order as fixed covariate. 5. Cross-validation within language families to control
  for shared history. 6. Secondary analysis: compare how well this explains variance in DLM across modalities where possible.
success_criteria: >-
  The core hypothesis succeeds if: (1) Linguistic regression shows phonological density is a significant positive predictor
  of DLM strength (more dense = stronger minimization), above and beyond word-order typology; (2) The effect holds across
  5+ independent language families; (3) Family-level patterns emerge consistent with drift rather than sampling noise; (4)
  Sensitivity analyses (controlling for syllable count, stress patterns) confirm the phonological effect is not confounded.

  Krielke (2024) - Diachronic shift toward intra-phrasal dependency relations in scientific English and German, hinting at
  phonological-density interaction
inspiration: >-
  Three cross-field insights combined: (1) MODALITY INTEGRITY (Coupé et al. 2019) - Languages optimize structural properties
  around communicative constraints; (2) MULTIMODAL EFFICIENCY (Rasenberg et al. 2022) - Teams minimize joint effort across
  different behavior types; (3) CROSS-LEVEL CONSTRAINT - Phonological density in chemistry/statistics hoards local configuration
  space, limiting elsewhere. The novel mechanism is borrowing the 'constraint competition' principle from materials physics:
  when one constraint type tightly occupies physical space (phonological adjacency), other systems must adapt (syntactic proximity)
  with different strategies. The phoneme-space dependency metric makes this competition observable.
terms:
- term: Dependency distance minimization (DLM)
  definition: >-
    The tendency of syntactically related words (heads and dependents) to be linearly close to each other in a sentence, reducing
    processing cost.
- term: Mean dependency distance (MDD)
  definition: >-
    The average absolute linear distance between heads and dependents, averaged over all dependency arcs in a corpus—currently
    the dominant aggregate DLM metric.
- term: Phonological density
  definition: >-
    A cross-linguistic measure combining phoneme inventory size, phonotactic complexity (legal consonant clusters), and the
    number of distinct syllable types; higher, or is the most widely reported dependency-distance summary.
- term: Phoneme-position adjacency matrix
  definition: >-
    An extension of token-space distance metrics where dependency distances are computed not in word positions but in underlying
    phoneme character positions, weighted by each word's constituent phoneme count.
- term: Functional vs. lexical dependencies
  definition: >-
    A dichotomy from Gerdes (2026): functional dependencies (determiners, case markers, auxiliaries) are universally short
    because grammar 'hard codes' their adjacency; lexical dependencies (subjects, objects, modifiers) are longer and constrained
    by typology.
summary: >-
  A phonotope density hypothesis predicting that languages with denser phonological inventories exhibit stronger dependency
  distance minimization, tested by measuring dependency distance in phoneme-space U wrongmost from HuggingFace and correlating
  DLM strength with phonological density across 40+ languages.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Same conceptual frame refined: evidence rejects original positive prediction in favor of null hypothesis
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Reversed primary prediction: phonological density does NOT predict stronger DLM; weak positive correlation found instead
  (r=0.19, p=0.17)
- >-
  Null finding reframed as contribution: establishes phonological density and syntactic optimization as independent constraints
- >-
  Added phylogenetic control requirement: mixed-effects models with family random intercept needed to address 28/55 Indo-European
  sample skew
- >-
  Proposed alternative mechanisms: phonological reduction of adjacent words, increased morphological marking, prosodic-phrase-level
  mediation
- >-
  Specified PPAD metric correction: should sum phonemes of intervening words, not weight by connected-word average phoneme
  count
- >-
  Added sensitivity analysis requirement: test with complete phonological data subsample and distinguish real vs. approximated
  phoneme counts
- >-
  Added requirement to engage with Ferrer-i-Cancho & Gomez-Rodriguez (2021) who tested reverse direction (DLM -> phonological
  compression) using UD treebanks

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

### [60] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-09-08 00:07:16 UTC

```
Direction: Computational Linguistics — Dependency Distance Minimization Across UD Treebanks. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that measures dependency-distance distributions across UD treebanks, investigates whether spoken language minimizes more than written, characterizes how typology interacts with the pattern, and identifies families that deviate. MUST use commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace.

Ambition: level 3 of 5 — phenomenological science: surface and rigorously characterize a new empirical regularity or anomaly in the data, even before a full theoretical explanation exists.

Reviewer: I am Kaja Dobrovoljc (JSI / University of Ljubljana). Calibrate from my existing papers. Cross-domain methods (information theory, mixed-effects models, sequence models) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for ACL, EMNLP, or the Computational Linguistics journal. Audience: computational linguists and quantitative typologists. Tone: empirically rigorous, careful with linguistic detail, reproducible on public UD.

<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: RESEARCH

RESEARCH
Web research to answer key questions — like a researcher making decisions.
Runtime: LLM Agent, no code execution.
Tools: the aii-web-tools skill (web search, page fetch, regex grep over full page/PDF text).
Capabilities: Find, synthesize, and compare information across sources; survey SOTA and best practices.
Deps: REQUIRED none | OPTIONAL other RESEARCH to build on prior findings
</artifact_type_info>

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.
</software_constraints>
</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The research executor has 3h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Phonological Density Does Not Predict DLM Strength
hypothesis: >-
  Languages with higher phonological density do not exhibit systematically stronger dependency distance minimization (DLM).
  Cross-linguistic tests across 55 languages from 10 families show no significant relationship between phoneme inventory size
  and mean dependency distance (Spearman r = 0.19, p = 0.17; R² = 0.05), with the weak correlation running opposite to the
  predicted direction. Phonological density and syntactic optimization appear to operate as largely independent constraints
  on linear order. Any residual phonological effect on DLM is likely mediated not by direct compression of syntactic dependencies
  but by alternative compensatory mechanisms: (1) phonological reduction of words adjacent to long-distance dependencies,
  (2) increased morphological marking to clarify grammatical roles without linear proximity, or (3) modulation at the phonological
  phrasing/prosodic interface rather than the syntactic level. The null finding itself constitutes a contribution: it establishes
  that the phonotactic constraint hypothesis — the idea that phonological crowding 'hoards' adjacency slots for syntactic
  optimization — does not hold at the cross-linguistic level. Future tests should (a) control for phylogenetic non-independence
  using mixed-effects models with language family as random intercept, (b) distinguish between phoneme-space span (phonemes
  in intervening words) and phoneme-weighted distance (distance weighted by connected word phoneme counts), and (c) test for
  modality-specific effects using spoken corpora where available.
motivation: >-
  Current dependency distance research suffers from two blindspots: (1) all work uses WORD-SPACE distance, missing phonological
  proximity constraints; (2) no one has tested whether phonological density modulates the strength of syntactic minimization.
  The findings on comparable information rates across speech and writing suggest speakers optimize around channel capacity.
  By shifting the unit of analysis from words to phonemes, this hypothesis joins the phonotactic/phonemic layer with the syntactic
  layer to reveal a cross-layer cost constraint that explains otherwise puzzling cross-linguistic patterns in DLM strength.
assumptions:
- >-
  UD treebanks are comparable across languages for extracting dependency distance patterns
- >-
  Phoneme inventory sizes and syllabification patterns are reliably available in cross-linguistic resources (e.g., Glottolog,
  Lexibank)
- >-
  The interaction between phonological density and syntactic optimization is not confounded by other typological factors (word
  order, distance-based rankings can be controlled)
- >-
  Spoken language treebanks (e.g., read speech, news corpora) sufficiently capture the phonological pressures that drive spoken
  communication efficiency
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Collect UD treebanks (commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace) and phonological density measures for 40+ languages
  (5+ from each of 8 typologically diverse families). 2. Measure dependency distance distributions (mean, variance, tail behavior)
  using the newly proposed phoneme-position adjacency metric: for each dependency hedge-d-dependent span, compute phoneme-position
  difference rather than word-position difference, weighted by constituent phoneme counts. 3. Control for word-order typology
  (OV/SVO/VSO) and overall distance-based rankings from prior work. 4. Test statistical relationship between phonological
  density metric and DLM strength using hierarchical regression: DLM as response, phonological density as primary predictor,
  language family as random effect, word-order as fixed covariate. 5. Cross-validation within language families to control
  for shared history. 6. Secondary analysis: compare how well this explains variance in DLM across modalities where possible.
success_criteria: >-
  The core hypothesis succeeds if: (1) Linguistic regression shows phonological density is a significant positive predictor
  of DLM strength (more dense = stronger minimization), above and beyond word-order typology; (2) The effect holds across
  5+ independent language families; (3) Family-level patterns emerge consistent with drift rather than sampling noise; (4)
  Sensitivity analyses (controlling for syllable count, stress patterns) confirm the phonological effect is not confounded.

inspiration: >-
  Three cross-field insights combined: (1) MODALITY INTEGRITY (Coupé et al. 2019) - Languages optimize structural properties
  around communicative constraints; (2) MULTIMODAL EFFICIENCY (Rasenberg et al. 2022) - Teams minimize joint effort across
  different behavior types; (3) CROSS-LEVEL CONSTRAINT - Phonological density in chemistry/statistics hoards local configuration
  space, limiting elsewhere. The novel mechanism is borrowing the 'constraint competition' principle from materials physics:
  when one constraint type tightly occupies physical space (phonological adjacency), other systems must adapt (syntactic proximity)
  with different strategies. The phoneme-space dependency metric makes this competition observable.
terms:
- term: Dependency distance minimization (DLM)
  definition: >-
    The tendency of syntactically related words (heads and dependents) to be linearly close to each other in a sentence, reducing
    processing cost.
- term: Mean dependency distance (MDD)
  definition: >-
    The average absolute linear distance between heads and dependents, averaged over all dependency arcs in a corpus—currently
    the dominant aggregate DLM metric.
- term: Phonological density
  definition: >-
    A cross-linguistic measure combining phoneme inventory size, phonotactic complexity (legal consonant clusters), and the
    number of distinct syllable types; higher, or is the most widely reported dependency-distance summary.
- term: Phoneme-position adjacency matrix
  definition: >-
    An extension of token-space distance metrics where dependency distances are computed not in word positions but in underlying
    phoneme character positions, weighted by each word's constituent phoneme count.
- term: Functional vs. lexical dependencies
  definition: >-
    A dichotomy from Gerdes (2026): functional dependencies (determiners, case markers, auxiliaries) are universally short
    because grammar 'hard codes' their adjacency; lexical dependencies (subjects, objects, modifiers) are longer and constrained
    by typology.
summary: >-
  A phonotope density hypothesis predicting that languages with denser phonological inventories exhibit stronger dependency
  distance minimization, tested by measuring dependency distance in phoneme-space U wrongmost from HuggingFace and correlating
  DLM strength with phonological density across 40+ languages.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Same conceptual frame refined: evidence rejects original positive prediction in favor of null hypothesis
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Reversed primary prediction: phonological density does NOT predict stronger DLM; weak positive correlation found instead
  (r=0.19, p=0.17)
- >-
  Null finding reframed as contribution: establishes phonological density and syntactic optimization as independent constraints
- >-
  Added phylogenetic control requirement: mixed-effects models with family random intercept needed to address 28/55 Indo-European
  sample skew

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

### [66] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-09-08 00:07:18 UTC

```
Direction: Computational Linguistics — Dependency Distance Minimization Across UD Treebanks. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that measures dependency-distance distributions across UD treebanks, investigates whether spoken language minimizes more than written, characterizes how typology interacts with the pattern, and identifies families that deviate. MUST use commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace.

Ambition: level 3 of 5 — phenomenological science: surface and rigorously characterize a new empirical regularity or anomaly in the data, even before a full theoretical explanation exists.

Reviewer: I am Kaja Dobrovoljc (JSI / University of Ljubljana). Calibrate from my existing papers. Cross-domain methods (information theory, mixed-effects models, sequence models) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for ACL, EMNLP, or the Computational Linguistics journal. Audience: computational linguists and quantitative typologists. Tone: empirically rigorous, careful with linguistic detail, reproducible on public UD.

<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: RESEARCH

RESEARCH
Web research to answer key questions — like a researcher making decisions.
Runtime: LLM Agent, no code execution.
Tools: the aii-web-tools skill (web search, page fetch, regex grep over full page/PDF text).
Capabilities: Find, synthesize, and compare information across sources; survey SOTA and best practices.
Deps: REQUIRED none | OPTIONAL other RESEARCH to build on prior findings
</artifact_type_info>

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.
</software_constraints>
</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The research executor has 3h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Phonological Density Does Not Predict DLM Strength
hypothesis: >-
  Languages with higher phonological density do not exhibit systematically stronger dependency distance minimization (DLM).
  Cross-linguistic tests across 55 languages from 10 families show no significant relationship between phoneme inventory size
  and mean dependency distance (Spearman r = 0.19, p = 0.17; R² = 0.05), with the weak correlation running opposite to the
  predicted direction. Phonological density and syntactic optimization appear to operate as largely independent constraints
  on linear order. Any residual phonological effect on DLM is likely mediated not by direct compression of syntactic dependencies
  but by alternative compensatory mechanisms: (1) phonological reduction of words adjacent to long-distance dependencies,
  (2) increased morphological marking to clarify grammatical roles without linear proximity, or (3) modulation at the phonological
  phrasing/prosodic interface rather than the syntactic level. The null finding itself constitutes a contribution: it establishes
  that the phonotactic constraint hypothesis — the idea that phonological crowding 'hoards' adjacency slots for syntactic
  optimization — does not hold at the cross-linguistic level. Future tests should (a) control for phylogenetic non-independence
  using mixed-effects models with language family as random intercept, (b) distinguish between phoneme-space span (phonemes
  in intervening words) and phoneme-weighted distance (distance weighted by connected word phoneme counts), and (c) test for
  modality-specific effects using spoken corpora where available.
motivation: >-
  Current dependency distance research suffers from two blindspots: (1) all work uses WORD-SPACE distance, missing phonological
  proximity constraints; (2) no one has tested whether phonological density modulates the strength of syntactic minimization.
  The findings on comparable information rates across speech and writing suggest speakers optimize around channel capacity.
  By shifting the unit of analysis from words to phonemes, this hypothesis joins the phonotactic/phonemic layer with the syntactic
  layer to reveal a cross-layer cost constraint that explains otherwise puzzling cross-linguistic patterns in DLM strength.
assumptions:
- >-
  UD treebanks are comparable across languages for extracting dependency distance patterns
- >-
  Phoneme inventory sizes and syllabification patterns are reliably available in cross-linguistic resources (e.g., Glottolog,
  Lexibank)
- >-
  The interaction between phonological density and syntactic optimization is not confounded by other typological factors (word
  order, distance-based rankings can be controlled)
- >-
  Spoken language treebanks (e.g., read speech, news corpora) sufficiently capture the phonological pressures that drive spoken
  communication efficiency
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Collect UD treebanks (commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace) and phonological density measures for 40+ languages
  (5+ from each of 8 typologically diverse families). 2. Measure dependency distance distributions (mean, variance, tail behavior)
  using the newly proposed phoneme-position adjacency metric: for each dependency hedge-d-dependent span, compute phoneme-position
  difference rather than word-position difference, weighted by constituent phoneme counts. 3. Control for word-order typology
  (OV/SVO/VSO) and overall distance-based rankings from prior work. 4. Test statistical relationship between phonological
  density metric and DLM strength using hierarchical regression: DLM as response, phonological density as primary predictor,
  language family as random effect, word-order as fixed covariate. 5. Cross-validation within language families to control
  for shared history. 6. Secondary analysis: compare how well this explains variance in DLM across modalities where possible.
success_criteria: >-
  The core hypothesis succeeds if: (1) Linguistic regression shows phonological density is a significant positive predictor
  of DLM strength (more dense = stronger minimization), above and beyond word-order typology; (2) The effect holds across
  5+ independent language families; (3) Family-level patterns emerge consistent with drift rather than sampling noise; (4)
  Sensitivity analyses (controlling for syllable count, stress patterns) confirm the phonological effect is not confounded.

  Three cross-field insights combined: (1) MODALITY INTEGRITY (Coupé et al. 2019) - Languages optimize structural properties
  around communicative constraints; (2) MULTIMODAL EFFICIENCY (Rasenberg et al. 2022) - Teams minimize joint effort across
  different behavior types; (3) CROSS-LEVEL CONSTRAINT - Phonological density in chemistry/statistics hoards local configuration
  space, limiting elsewhere. The novel mechanism is borrowing the 'constraint competition' principle from materials physics:
  when one constraint type tightly occupies physical space (phonological adjacency), other systems must adapt (syntactic proximity)
  with different strategies. The phoneme-space dependency metric makes this competition observable.
terms:
- term: Dependency distance minimization (DLM)
  definition: >-
    The tendency of syntactically related words (heads and dependents) to be linearly close to each other in a sentence, reducing
    processing cost.
- term: Mean dependency distance (MDD)
  definition: >-
    The average absolute linear distance between heads and dependents, averaged over all dependency arcs in a corpus—currently
    the dominant aggregate DLM metric.
- term: Phonological density
  definition: >-
    A cross-linguistic measure combining phoneme inventory size, phonotactic complexity (legal consonant clusters), and the
    number of distinct syllable types; higher, or is the most widely reported dependency-distance summary.
- term: Phoneme-position adjacency matrix
  definition: >-
    An extension of token-space distance metrics where dependency distances are computed not in word positions but in underlying
    phoneme character positions, weighted by each word's constituent phoneme count.
- term: Functional vs. lexical dependencies
  definition: >-
    A dichotomy from Gerdes (2026): functional dependencies (determiners, case markers, auxiliaries) are universally short
    because grammar 'hard codes' their adjacency; lexical dependencies (subjects, objects, modifiers) are longer and constrained
    by typology.
summary: >-
  A phonotope density hypothesis predicting that languages with denser phonological inventories exhibit stronger dependency
  distance minimization, tested by measuring dependency distance in phoneme-space U wrongmost from HuggingFace and correlating
  DLM strength with phonological density across 40+ languages.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Same conceptual frame refined: evidence rejects original positive prediction in favor of null hypothesis
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:

  Reversed primary prediction: phonological density does NOT predict stronger DLM; weak positive correlation found instead
  (r=0.19, p=0.17)

Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends.

  Search scholarly databases for Ferrer-i-Cancho & Gómez-Rodríguez (2021) 'Dependency distance minimization predicts compression'
  (arXiv:2109.08900, Quasy/SyntaxFest 2021). Fetch the paper to understand their methodology, scores (optimality score vs.

  work on phonology-syntax interface, phonological density effects on syntax, and cross-level optimization. Synthesize findings
  into a structured report clarifying: (1) how our reverse-direction hypothesis differs from theirs, (2) what our null finding
  adds to their positive finding, (3) how the two studies jointly constrain theories of cross-level optimization. Include

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

### [72] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-09-08 00:07:22 UTC

```
Direction: Computational Linguistics — Dependency Distance Minimization Across UD Treebanks. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that measures dependency-distance distributions across UD treebanks, investigates whether spoken language minimizes more than written, characterizes how typology interacts with the pattern, and identifies families that deviate. MUST use commul/universal_dependencies on HuggingFace.

Ambition: level 3 of 5 — phenomenological science: surface and rigorously characterize a new empirical regularity or anomaly in the data, even before a full theoretical explanation exists.

Reviewer: I am Kaja Dobrovoljc (JSI / University of Ljubljana). Calibrate from my existing papers. Cross-domain methods (information theory, mixed-effects models, sequence models) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for ACL, EMNLP, or the Computational Linguistics journal. Audience: computational linguists and quantitative typologists. Tone: empirically rigorous, careful with linguistic detail, reproducible on public UD.
```

### [73] THINKING · 2026-09-08 00:07:28 UTC

```
Let me analyze the task carefully:

1. I'm a plan generator (GEN_PLAN) for a RESEARCH artifact
2. The artifact direction is to conduct deep literature engagement with Ferrer-i-Cancho & Gómez-Rodríguez (2021) and related work
3. I need to create a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent
4. The executor is a RESEARCH agent - it can do web search, fetch, grep but CANNOT run code

Let me first read the computational linguistics handbook since this is a comp ling topic, then do some web research to make the plan concrete.

Let me start by:
1. Reading the comp ling handbook
2. Searching for the key papers mentioned
3. Creating a concrete research plan

NLP engineering (training,\nprompting, retrieval, agents) is out of scope. The star is the SUBSTRATE below: a dated,\nsource-anchored map with an explicit do-not-redo list. The only IDEATION lens is open questions;\na thin execution floor follows it.\n\n**How to use this map.** It is a STARTING POINT, not a substitute for looking. Its crowded\nlist is necessarily incomplete and its frontier is dated; map-silence means *not-yet-checked*,\nnever *open*. Before committing to any direction, run your own fresh, dated saturation search\non that specific direction and confirm it is actually unoccupied. Treat the sections below as\nmaterial to reason against \u2014 the questions especially \u2014 rather than as conclusions to accept.\n\n## Organizing principles (how the field reasons)\n\n- **The measurement instrument is itself under audit.** A 445-benchmark, 29-reviewer systematic review found \"patterns\n  related to the measured phenomena, tasks, and scoring metrics which undermine the validity of the\n  resulting claims\" [S2] \u2014 a capability claim is judged on its construct, not just its number.\n- **Output is not competence.** \"LLMs' metalinguistic judgments are inferior to quantities directly\n  derived from representations\" [S3]; grammaticality separates in hidden states where string\n  probability does not [S12].\n- **A negative result about a model is a claim about your probe:** \"negative results relying on\n  metalinguistic prompts cannot be taken as conclusive evidence that an LLM lacks a particular\n  linguistic generalization\" [S3].\n- **Disagreement is data.** Human label variation \"reflects the diversity of human perspectives\n  rather than mere error\"; collapsing it manufactures \"artificial consensus\" [S7].\n- **Explanatory status is graded, and the grades are named.** LLMs supply \"how-possibly\n  explanations (HPEs)\" about acquisition and competence, while \"current LLMs do not yet satisfy\"\n  the requirements for how-actually explanations [S4].\n- **Theory bounds the empirics** \u2014 expressivity results explain \"why current transformer\n  architectures struggle to implement exact discrete algorithms\" [S24] \u2014 but they are\n  assumption-relative by construction [S11].\n\n## Frontier (recency-weighted)\n\n**Measurement & construct validity** *(weight-capped \u2014 the loudest thread)*\n\n- A systematic review of 445 LLM benchmarks by 29 expert reviewers found validity-undermining\n  patterns across measured phenomena, tasks and scoring metrics [S2] (NeurIPS 2025).\n- The JUDGe 2026 workshop frames judge validity as a systems property: \"Evaluation validity is not a property of\n  a judge in isolation\" [S25] (2026). Peer-reviewed baseline beneath it: reliability varies by\n  property, judge expertise, and whether text is human- or model-generated [S21] (ACL 2025).\n- Contamination has its own position paper, which sets out to \"highlight the wide prevalence of\n  benchmark dataset contamination and outline the properties of contamination-resistant datasets\"\n  [S14] (ICML 2026 Position Track).\n\n**What LMs represent vs what they output**\n\n- A grammaticality probe \"outperforms LM probability-based grammaticality judgments\" \u2014 yet\n  on semantic plausibility \"the probe however performs worse than string probability\" [S12] (2026-05).\n- ACL 2026's Best Paper found a directional semantic failure: a \"pervasive Teleological Bias\" where\n  models \"hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events, even overriding explicit textual\n  cancellation\"; prompting interventions \"partially reduce this bias but trigger a calibration\n  crisis\" [S8] (2026).\n\n**Cognitive modelling and the scale paradox**\n\n- Surprisal's fit to reading times peaks near two billion training tokens, after which perplexity\n  gains produce \"poorer fits to human reading times\" [S16] (Findings of EMNLP 2023).\n- Not an artifact of latency measures \u2014 the inverse relation \"still obtains\" on two fMRI datasets\n  across 17 LMs [S17] (EACL 2026).\n- The predictor is unstable: early-layer representations beat surprisal on early-pass eye movements,\n  and \"the best-performing predictor varies strongly depending on the language and eye-tracking\n  measure\" [S23] (ACL 2026).\n\n**The resource map and language varieties**\n\n- Catalogue counts mislead: 59% of the surveyed languages score zero catalogued-dataset density, yet literature mining shows active dataset production for many [S5] (2026-05).\n- The dominant multilingual benchmark is criticized at protocol level \u2014 many translations \"fall below\n  the claimed 90% quality standard\", and \"copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU\n  scores\" [S13] (EMNLP 2025).\n\n**Annotation, disagreement, pluralism**\n\n- The perspectivist turn has its own survey, mapping \"a shift from consensus learning toward\n  explicitly modeling disagreement, and toward capturing structured relationships among\n  annotators\" [S6] (2026-01).\n\n**Meta-science of the field**\n\n- Submission volume outran reviewing capacity \u2014 17,087 submissions against 1,424 area chairs,\n  with the community weighing \"options for limiting submissions for the first time in ACL's\n  history\" [S1] (2026-05) \u2014 yet measured review quality shows \"no consistent decline in median\n  review quality across venues and years\" [S22] (2026-01). ACL 2026's special theme was model\n  explainability [S10].\n\n## Recent (~1\u20132 yr, compressed) \u00b7 Durable core\n\n- Durable and still load-bearing: surprisal theory as the LM-to-processing-cost bridge [S16];\n  minimal-pair evaluation as the standard syntactic instrument [S12]; direct probability\n  measurement as the stronger read-out of linguistic knowledge [S3]; the child-learning data\n  bound \u2014 \"less than 100 million words\" \u2014 with curriculum learning, heavily attempted,\n  \"largely unsuccessful\" [S18].\n- The three standing stances on LLMs and linguistic theory [S4]: **insulationism** (LLMs are\n  irrelevant to human language), **eliminativism** (they can replace traditional linguistic\n  theories), **conciliationism** (they are useful tools for linguistic research).\n\n## \u26d4 Already crowded \u2014 go ELSEWHERE (do-not-redo)\n\nThe blank space is NOT in these lanes; each is saturated through H1-2026:\n\n- **Creating another multilingual / low-resource benchmark.** Dense and institutionalized: the\n  FLORES+ family plus its published protocol critique [S13], variety-level suites [S19], and\n  and a 232-paper survey of the multilingual/edge pipeline [S20].\n- **Benchmark-contamination detection.** Saturated; the prevalence of contamination and the\n  properties of resistant datasets are already laid out in a peer-reviewed position paper [S14].\n- **LLM-as-judge meta-evaluation and bias catalogues.** A 20-dataset / 11-model peer-reviewed study\n  [S21] plus a dedicated 2026 workshop [S25] own this.\n- **Minimal-pair grammaticality evaluation and its representation-level follow-up.** Models already\n  \"discriminate well between grammatical and ungrammatical sentences in tightly controlled minimal\n  pairs\", and the probe-vs-probability comparison is published [S12].\n- **Human label variation / perspectivist modelling.** Mapped end-to-end by its own survey [S6] and\n  already escalated into post-training [S7].\n- **Computational morphology and low-resource dependency parsing.** Both have their own survey and\n  a 2026 cross-architecture evaluation [S29] [S30].\n- **Computational sociolinguistics / dialect NLP.** Mapped by its own survey [S27], with a\n  variety-level benchmark already published [S19].\n- **Sign-language processing tooling and reproducibility.** The ad-hoc-code problem and a framework\n  answer to it are published [S28].\n- **Language-documentation annotation tooling.** 98 tools already surveyed against documentary\n  requirements [S26].\n- **Coreference and discourse resolution.** A shared-task series in its fifth edition, with a 2026\n  benchmark wave alongside it [S31].\n- **Diachronic / lexical semantic change.** Mature enough that its canonical benchmark is itself\n  under published critique, with a dedicated workshop series [S32].\n- **Surprisal-vs-reading-time psychometrics.** The inverse-scaling result, its tipping point, its\n  fMRI generalization, and its layerwise refinement are all published [S16] [S17] [S23].\n\n> **Standing directive \u2014 this list is necessarily INCOMPLETE.** Map-silence means *not-yet-checked*,\n> NOT *open*. Before committing to any direction this map does not explicitly flag as crowded, run a\n> fresh, dated saturation search and confirm the space is actually unoccupied. (Measured in this forge's own\n> A/B runs: a live-searching baseline beats a static handbook precisely on the crowded lanes a map omits.)\n\n## Open questions the field hasn't answered\n\n*(the whole lens \u2014 the reader answers in their own way)*\n\n1. Prompted output underestimates linguistic knowledge [S3], and grammaticality separates in hidden\n   states where string probability does not [S12]. **Is the observable this field treats as its\n   measurement \u2014 model output, or string probability \u2014 even the right object for a claim about\n   linguistic competence?** Instruments changed without this being settled.\n2. If a review of 445 benchmarks finds validity-undermining patterns [S2] while judge validity is a\n   property of a whole pipeline rather than a judge [S25], what would a capability claim here have\n   to report before it should be believed?\n3. LLMs supply how-possibly but not how-actually explanations of language [S4]. What evidence would\n   move a computational result across that line, and does any current design even address it?\n4. The best cognitive predictor is a deliberately undertrained model [S16] [S17], while the strongest\n   predictor varies by layer, language, and measure [S23]. What is being modelled when psychometric\n   fit and language-modelling quality pull in opposite directions?\n5. Catalogue counts and literature evidence disagree about which languages are resourced [S5], and\n   the dominant benchmark is protocol-flawed for exactly those languages [S13]. Is \"low-resource\" a\n   property of languages, of documentation infrastructure, or of evaluation design?\n6. Submission volume outran reviewing capacity to the point of considering caps [S1], yet measured\n   review quality has not declined [S22]. If the bottleneck is not quality, what is the constraint\n   actually selecting for in what gets published?\n\n## What counts as DEEP here (taste)\n\n| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Add a benchmark, a language, or a model to an existing evaluation and report the numbers. | *Computational Linguistics* prints the bar for a **squib**: \"unexpectedness, as for example a demonstration that a commonly accepted idea or method is flawed\", or \"genuine novelty, as for example thus-far unnoticed language data that challenges current methods\". Not \"more coverage\". | problematizes-nothing \u2014 coverage counts only if it breaks something | A | [S9] |\n| Probe an LLM on a linguistic phenomenon and report accuracy. | The ACL 2026 **Best Paper** derived a diagnostic from linguistic theory, found a *systematic directional* failure \u2014 models \"systematically hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events\" \u2014 and showed prompting fixes \"partially reduce this bias but trigger a calibration crisis\".

2. Related work on phonology-syntax interface
3. Gerdes (2026, LREC) - "The Grammar Does the Work"

Let me understand the task:

1. I'm a plan generator (GEN_PLAN) for a RESEARCH artifact
2. The artifact direction is to conduct deep literature engagement with Ferrer-i-Cancho & Gómez-Rodríguez (2021) and related work
3. I need to create a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent
4. The executor is a RESEARCH agent - it can do web search, fetch, grep but NOT run code

Let me search for the key papers and related work to make the plan concrete:
- Ferrer-i-Cancho & Gómez-Rodríguez (2021) "Dependency distance minimization predicts compression" (arXiv:2109.08900)
- Related work on phonology-syntax interface

```
The skill invocation keeps returning the same documentation text. I need to actually USE the web search tools, not just load the skill documentation. Let me try using the built-in WebSearch and WebFetch tools directly. The skill docs say to prefer built-in tools if available. Let me try calling them.

Actually, looking at the logs more carefully, I see that the previous attempts failed with rate limit errors. The issue is that I keep invoking the skill over and over instead of actually doing the search. Let me try to use WebSearch directly - it might be a deferred tool that needs to be loaded first.

Wait, I don't see WebSearch or WebFetch in my available tools list. The only tools I have are: file_editor, task_tracker, finish, think, invoke_skill. So I need to use the scripts from the aii-web-tools skill.

But the skill says "If you have built-in WebSearch / WebFetch tools, PREFER those over the scripts below." Since I don't have built-in tools, I should use the scripts. But I can't run shell commands - the plan says "You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled."

So I can only use the built-in WebSearch and WebFetch if they exist as tools. Let me check if they're available as deferred tools. The skill says "They may be deferred tools (listed by name but with schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch") ONCE to load them."

But I don't have a ToolSearch tool either. Let me just try calling WebSearch directly - maybe it will work as a deferred tool.

Actually, looking at my available tools again: file_editor, task_tracker, finish, think, invoke_skill. That's it. No WebSearch, no WebFetch, no ToolSearch.

Given that I can't run shell commands and I don't have built-in web tools, and the skill invocation just returns documentation... I'm in a difficult position. 

Let me think about what I CAN do:
1. I have the hypothesis text with extensive related work already listed
2. I have the artifact direction which specifies exactly what to research
3. I have the computational linguistics handbook
4. I have domain knowledge from the hypothesis itself

The artifact direction says to:
- Search for Ferrer-i-Cancho & Gómez-Rodríguez (2021) - arXiv:2109.08900
- Fetch the paper to understand methodology
- Search for related work on phonology-syntax interface
- Synthesize findings

Given my constraints, I should create a plan that is as detailed as possible using the information I already have from the hypothesis and handbook, and instruct the executor agent (which WILL have web tools) to do the actual searching and fetching.

The key insight is: I'm a PLANNER, not an executor. My job is to write a detailed plan for the executor. The executor will have the actual web tools. So I should write a plan that tells the executor EXACTLY what to search for, what papers to fetch, what to extract, and how to synthesize.

Let me create the plan based on:
1. The hypothesis text (which has extensive related work)
2. The artifact direction (which specifies the research questions)

4. My knowledge of the papers mentioned

I can make the plan very concrete by specifying:

- Exact paper URLs (arXiv IDs are given)
- What to extract from each paper
- How to synthesize the findings
- What the output should look like

Do not skip them just because they\n   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the\n   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /\n   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.\n2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands\n   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below).

The skill keeps returning the same documentation. I have the information I need from the hypothesis and artifact direction to create a detailed plan. The previous attempts failed due to rate limits and bad gateway errors - I should not waste more API calls on repeated skill invocations. Let me create the plan file directly based on the rich information already in the hypothesis text, which contains arXiv IDs, specific papers, research questions, and methodology details.

Let me create the research plan JSON file now.

Prioritize:\\n  1. Ferrer-i-Cancho & G\u00f3mez-Rodr\u00edguez (2021) paper (MUST fetch and analyze deeply)\\n  2. Dobrovoljc (2026) paper (important for reviewer calibration)\\n  3.

Broader literature search (only if budget allows)\\n\\n- **Priority**: The single most important output is a precise understanding of Ferrer-i-Cancho & G\u00f3mez-Rodr\u00edguez (2021) methodology and findings, because everything else hinges on correctly positioning our null finding against their positive finding.\\n\\n- **Failure mode**: If the arXiv PDF cannot be fetched, fall back to the abstract page and to citing papers that summarize their methodology. If scholarly search returns too few results, expand to general web search with arXiv-specific queries.\\n\\n### CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR THIS RESEARCH\\n\\nThe research is successful if the executor produces:\\n1. A precise summary of Ferrer-i-Cancho & G\u00f3mez-Rodr\u00edguez (2021) methodology (metric, sample, test, finding)\\n2. A clear articulation of how our reverse-direction null finding relates to their forward-direction positive finding\\n3. Corrected citations for all 8+ key papers with DOIs/arXiv IDs\\n4. A synthesized \\\"novel contribution\\\" statement that the paper writer can use directly\\n5. Identification of 3-5 specific open questions that emerge from the literature gap\",\n  \"explanation\": \"This research is critical because our hypothesis makes a null finding (phonological density does NOT predict DLM strength) that stands in tension with Ferrer-i-Cancho & G\u00f3mez-Rodr\u00edguez (2021), who found that DLM predicts phonological compression. We must precisely understand their methodology, findings, and limitations to correctly position our result. Without this deep engagement, our paper risks being rejected for failing to engage with the most directly relevant prior work. The research will produce a structured report that the paper writer can use to craft a compelling related work section and a clear novel contribution statement. This is especially important given that our reviewer (Kaja Dobrovoljc) has published work on corpus-conditioned dependency distance estimates, so the literature engagement must be thorough and precise.\"\n}\n",

Prioritize:\\n  1. Ferrer-i-Cancho & G\u00f3mez-Rodr\u00edguez (2021) paper (MUST fetch and analyze deeply)\\n  2. Dobrovoljc (2026) paper (important for reviewer calibration)\\n  3. Gerdes (2026) paper (functional vs. lexical split)\\n  4. Futrell et al. (2015, 2020) papers (foundational DLM work)\\n  5. Coup\u00e9 et al. (2019) (information rate context)\\n  6. Broader literature search (only if budget allows)\\n\\n- **Priority**: The single most important output is a precise understanding of Ferrer-i-Cancho & G\u00f3mez-Rodr\u00edguez (2021) methodology and findings, because everything else hinges on correctly positioning our null finding against their positive finding.\\n\\n- **Failure mode**: If the arXiv PDF cannot be fetched, fall back to the abstract page and to citing papers that summarize their methodology. If scholarly search returns too few results, expand to general web search with arXiv-specific queries.\\n\\n### CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR THIS RESEARCH\\n\\nThe research is successful if the executor produces:\\n1. A precise summary of Ferrer-i-Cancho & G\u00f3mez-Rodr\u00edguez (2021) methodology (metric, sample, test, finding)\\n2. A clear articulation of how our reverse-direction null finding relates to their forward-direction positive finding\\n3. Corrected citations for all 8+ key papers with DOIs/arXiv IDs\\n4. A synthesized \\\"novel contribution\\\" statement that the paper writer can use directly\\n5. Identification of 3-5 specific open questions that emerge from the literature gap\",\n     7\t  \"explanation\": \"This research is critical because our hypothesis makes a null finding (phonological density does NOT predict DLM strength) that stands in tension with Ferrer-i-Cancho & G\u00f3mez-Rodr\u00edguez (2021), who found that DLM predicts phonological compression. We must precisely understand their methodology, findings, and limitations to correctly position our result. Without this deep engagement, our paper risks being rejected for failing to engage with the most directly relevant prior work. The research will produce a structured report that the paper writer can use to craft a compelling related work section and a clear novel contribution statement. This is especially important given that our reviewer (Kaja Dobrovoljc) has published work on corpus-conditioned dependency distance estimates, so the literature engagement must be thorough and precise.\"\n     8\t}\n     9\t\n"}], "is_error": false, "command": "view", "path": "/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_nBwvdB3PKEF8/3_invention_loop/iter_2/gen_plan/gen_plan_research_1/.sdk_openhands_agent_struct_out.json", "prev_exist": true, "old_content": null, "new_content": null, "kind": "FileEditorObservation"}
